para = """The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm, golden hue over the
          sleepy coastal town. The scent of saltwater mingled with the sweet
          fragrance of blooming jasmine as the gentle sea breeze swayed the palm
          trees. Children laughed in the distance, their voices echoing across
          the sandy shore, where a few scattered seashells shimmered in the
          fading light. A lone seagull glided overhead, its wings catching the
          last rays of daylight before it disappeared into the orange-tinged
          clouds. Everything felt peaceful, as if time had momentarily slowed,
          allowing nature to paint its final masterpiece for the day."""
