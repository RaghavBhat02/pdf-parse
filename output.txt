<div class="space-y-2 font-medium"><p class="p-8 italic">ceto-darpana-marjanam bhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanam sreyah-kairava-candrika-vitaranam vidya-vadhu-jivanam anandambudhi-vardhanam prati-padam purnamrtasvadanam sarvatma-snapanam param vijayate sri-krsna- sankirtanam</p><p>“Glory to the sri-krsna-sankirtana, which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life, of repeated birth and death. This sankirtana movement is the prime benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon. It is the life of all transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which we are always anxious.”</p><p>The first phrase, ceto-darpana-marjanam, means the cleansing of the mirror of the heart. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta explains that the dust of material contamination thoroughly covers the mirror of the heart of the conditioned soul, but the chanting of Lord Krsna’s name cleanses this mirror. The heart is a very special organ in the body. It is phenom- enal that the heart pumps nearly 2,000 gallons of blood in one day. Furthermore, the soul resides in the same region as the heart. When people undergo heart transplants, they often experience altera- tions in their personalities. These changes appear distinctly in some people since the consciousness is seated in the heart area and the subtle energy is constantly circulated throughout the body by the blood. Blood transfusions can also result in alterations of consciousness. Even the clothes of another person subtly carry their energy. People are constantly engaged in energy transfers. We pick up different energies simply by walking into another house or environment. For instance, the Bhaga- vatam explains that if one eats in a sinful place, one will pick up some of the sin from the atmosphere. The thoughts and actions of people permeate their environments. The consciousness of the cooks enters the food and especially the grains. We do not have to wonder why people experience so much trouble in the material energy. Everywhere they turn, they constantly get “zapped.” Fast food restaurants are even more mechanical and gross due to the type of ingredients, and especially due to the conscious- ness of the cooks who usually receive only minimum wage and hate their jobs. Furthermore, the environ- ment is filled with passionate people who are angry, disturbed, frustrated, lusty and depressed. Then, you enter and sit in the middle of this energy while the waiter or waitress brings you a plate of sin. Although they may smile at you and say, “Enjoy,” they are simply thinking, “Get out of here!” They have just served 100 people and feel exhausted. Although they ask how you enjoyed your meal, they just want to see your tip, and if you left only a small amount, they practically curse you as you walk out the door. They angrily think to themselves, “You took all of my time and simply see me as your slave. What can I do with this tip? I cannot even put gas in my car with this!” Consequently, the sin from the environment completely weighs you down; therefore, we need to chant the holy names, which cut away at the atmo- sphere and eradicate heavy contamination.</p><p>The contamination we pick up from these different environments must be cleansed. We constantly pick up something from our environment just as we may pick up a cold or flu on the bus or train. Often we travel around in contaminated airplanes, which pack hundreds of people into one little space for hours. Their mentalities and anxieties come from all different places and just bounce off the walls back onto us. These airplanes even subject us to the unnatural consequences of radiation, electromag- netic effects, and the pressure from accelerating and decelerating. The body was not designed to ascend to such heights or descend so rapidly. The more modern airplanes have started to re-circulate the air for efficiency, which means that the older planes are actually healthier than the more modern ones. Some pilots are becoming impotent due to that atmo- sphere and have even filed lawsuits. Considering these artificial impositions, we can understand how such situations lead to airport rage, school rage, road rage, office rage and even executive rage. When someone enters their office, they see computers and machines everywhere! It seems that people are becoming more and more disturbed, especially in America and Europe. Much of the disturbances result from electromagnetic influences. For example, in countries like South Africa and Japan, practically everyone has a cell phone. Even a small five-year-old girl may make a few phone calls and ask, “What kind of candy does the store in your neighborhood sell? I don’t like the candy from this store.” It is amazing to see everyone with personal phones. Although we use all these fax machines, computers, cell phones and other electromagnetic appliances, we should understand that they are not natural and even affect our nervous system and our minds. This energy bombards people’s existence, causing them to feel more tense, anxious and passionate. Many people will even develop sicknesses, which are difficult to repel, due to this energy.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Protecting Ourselves with the Holy Name</h2><p>The holy names help to cleanse us of all these contaminations constantly attacking us. When someone approaches us with a mundane conversa- tion and speaks offensively or gossips, it is as if they are dumping a barrel of garbage on us. Devotees communicate about everything, but if a relationship only involves dumping garbage, just ask the person: “I am glad to share, but can we take the conversa- tion to a higher level?” If they continue to share such garbage, we really have to endeavor to cleanse ourselves, which requires a good amount of time and energy. If we constantly get dumped on at work, on the streets while preaching, at home or else- where, we can expect that our consciousness will feel very dismal. We will even lose excitement about the devotional process. Some of the assaults will be unavoidable because, as we move about in different environments, people will attack us consciously or unconsciously. Everything involves the socialization of energies. For this reason, even one moment in the association of very advanced souls can cleanse us to such an extent that it plants a seed that can nourish us and help us eternally with our growth. You may feel surcharged after visiting different places of pilgrimage or after receiving nice senior association. You will feel different for a few days because they actually affect the atmosphere by bringing cleansing and clarification. Their presence helps to make alter- ations in what you are carrying and what you are experiencing. However, as time passes, the regular contamination begins to bombard you again and you return to business as usual. When the senior devotees come, everyone is on their best behavior and even smile at each other although sometimes they cannot stand one another. They think, “I can handle this for a week during their visit.” Then, for one week, everyone comes to the morning program and chants together. Actually, the senior devotees make a difference when they come because they bring a different kind of energy into the atmosphere. For this reason, we need to be more mindful in order to capture the full presence and blessings of the senior devotee, the presence of our guru, and to even more deeply capture the presence of what we read. We want to maintain these reflections so that they always stay with us.</p><p>Sometimes you may listen to a stimulating lecture, which helps you feel better in your services. You need to hold onto these reflections and let them live with you, not only for that moment, but constantly, so that they bring solace. These reflections can help you feel more cared for and protected, and help you understand the purpose of all the different types of austerities. These are actually heavy austerities. We are in the minority—everyone around us acts and speaks differently. Therefore, when we attend class or read from the scriptures, we should try to be mindful in order to absorb and imbibe the knowl- edge into our being. Then, when the bombardments face us, they will not affect us to the same degree. We will have the ability to shake them off. When we spend extensive time in the city, we become accus- tomed to the air pollution, the noise pollution and the electromagnetic pollution. However, if we spend some time in a rural environment and later return to the city, we will experience quite a difference. Some people work with different types of healing and are sensitive to the energies; therefore, they can identify those people who live in the cities due to the extra tension in the muscles and in the nervous system. This tension results from their day-to-day experi- ences. Prabhupada said that the cities are in the mode of passion, while the rural areas are in the mode of goodness. An environment helps to create a certain level of consciousness, and although we can avoid some of the influences, in general the environment can capture us. For this reason, it is good for those who live in the cities to take a walk in the park or forest or even visit a farm in order to leave these heavy energy exchanges. We can even see how people will unconsciously park their cars close to water, trees or greenery just to cool off. They may feel so uptight or anxious but the change in atmosphere seems to have a cleansing effect on them since it lacks the dominant presence of Kali- yuga. We see that Krsna lives in Vrndavana. The gopas do not go out to the factories, but they go to the forest and take care of the cows. It is not only a simple life but also a natural life.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">The “Dust” that Covers the Soul</h2><p>These examples of the ways in which the material energy constantly bombards us should help us to understand the contamination present on the mirror of our hearts. Just imagine a mirror completely covered by dust. Normally we can see our own image in a mirror, but the dust brings obfuscation and prevents us from seeing our own reflection clearly. This dust covers the soul. “Chanting Lord Krsna’s name cleanses the mirror of the conditioned soul’s polluted heart, which is wholly covered by three contaminations, namely material desires, the enjoying spirit, and ungodly atheistic activities” (Sri Siksastaka, 13). In other words, the dust that covers the soul comes in three forms and keeps the soul conditioned. This first type of dust is anyabhilasa, or desires separate from Krsna’s desires. The living entities that have become adverse to the Lord are filled with desires separate from the interest of God. Phala-bhoga, the second type of dust, means the enjoyment of worldly activities, or attachment to worldly or fruitive activities along with their results. The third covering, phala-tyaga, is almost the oppo- site. Phala-tyaga means that one practices renuncia- tion but not for the pleasure of the Lord. One can be improperly attached but one can also be improperly renounced. Not only can improper desires cover us over with improper activities and attachments, but they can also cause us to unnecessarily renounce certain things or renounce with the wrong inten- tions. One may practice renunciation just for glory, distinction and adoration, or engage in tapasya simply for power. Even Ravana and Jarasandha were very powerful. They both performed many different types of rituals but for improper reasons. Both improper attachment and improper renuncia- tion can contaminate the heart. Our activities must be performed with the proper consciousness and with the proper goals. As previously described, these three contaminations of dust cover the mirror of our heart and cause our conditioning. However, the chanting cleanses the heart of all the dust accu- mulated after years and years of such conditioning. “These treacherous contaminations cover the mirror of consciousness and cause the jiva to reject his true nature” (Sri Siksastaka, 13). Such contamina- tions are different types of deceit or kaitava which cover the jiva’s actual vision of its true identity. Once this dust is cleansed away, the vision and the natural activities of the soul can be fully expressed. Only then will we completely appreciate our position as Krsna’s servants. At this point, we become all for Krsna and Krsna becomes all for us.</p><p>While we chant these prayers each morning, we should simultaneously reflect on these points since the eight verses literally contain everything necessary to become fully Krsna conscious. We read many books and engage in so many activities mainly to help us control the mind, but these eight slokas contain everything. Lord Caitanya did not write many books because there was actually no need. He came to give the highest truth in the most simplistic, direct and potent way. If we perform a daily or periodic exercise of trying to go deeper and deeper into the meaning of these slokas, we will discover that everything else we can read about, hear about or experience is contained within them. We need to learn so much since our minds and intel- ligence are such rascals. We actually want to trick the mind and intelligence by occupying them with devotional thoughts and reflections while under- going the cleansing process. To the extent that our minds and intelligence are strong and powerful, we must learn to tame the wild mind just as one tames a wild horse. If a wild horse is not tamed, it will knock everything down, kick everyone and even run away. Due to its wild nature, it must come under great surveillance and monitoring until it decides to cooperate and recognize its boss. We have to go through so many rituals and study simply because our intelligence is devious and hyperactive. f we just chant the holy name with purity and potency, everything will be revealed. However, sometimes we have to hear more and even undergo certain expe- riences in order to take deeper shelter of the holy name. Ultimately, in Krsna consciousness we only need the maha-mantra, but before we can chant the names of Radha and Krsna and chant this message imported from the spiritual world, golokera prema- dhana hari-nama-sankirtana, we have to build up so much. From this perspective, we can realize what goes on in Krsna consciousness. Living entities from time immemorial have been finding expert ways to deny reality, expert ways to run away from their real identity and expert ways to minimize and deny Krsna’s love. Krsna arranges through scriptures, sadhus, gurus, plenary expansions, partial plenary expansions, incarnations, avataras, and even through His own personal presence to somehow encourage us to give up the unnecessary and reach out for the obvious truth we hide from.</p><p>For these reasons, Lord Caitanya comes Himself. Advaita Acarya and Narada Muni call Him, letting Him know that this is a serious time. The rascals in Kali-yuga need special mercy because they will not expend the effort to meditate, and even if they do, their minds will be everywhere. They will not be fixed in temple worship or yajnas, and although they will pretend, their minds will be in other places. Consequently, the Lord gives a process that can still benefit the people despite the wandering mind. Although the mind, the will and the emotions are all over the place, somehow there will still be a chance for advancement. Just by chanting the holy name in various environments, even those who have no interest can receive benedictions. Even those who are not very serious can still act as ambassadors to spread the chanting of the holy names. Therefore, as they chant, they purify themselves and other enti- ties while distributing the mercy to those who may be more destitute or insane than them. In this way, everyone will receive some blessings. Everyone on this planet is very fortunate due to the availability of the holy names, but some may take full advantage and be able to return to the spiritual kingdom. While repeating this verse, we can reflect on the mirror conception and the need to cleanse the dust from the mirror or heart.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Extinguishing the Fire of Material Existence</h2><p>The second phrase, bhava-maha-davagni- nirvapanam, means extinguishing the blazing forest fire of material existence. The senses are on fire and this material world is burning due to the many different types of suffering. The living entities in this material world experience three different types of suffering called adhyatmika, adhidaivika, and adhibhautika. Adhyatmika refers to the suffering caused by one’s own mind. Then one suffers adhidaivika; miseries caused by the demigods in the form of heat, cold, earth- quakes, tornados, hurricanes, etc. Finally, one suffers endless miseries from other living enti- ties, adhibhautika. Even from a small mosquito bite, we can undergo so much suffering and even die. During one trip to Africa I became very ill. I traveled to Botswana to have a meeting with the President of the country and nearly died from one little mosquito with malaria. My whole system was completely thrown off due to fever, weakness and hallucinations. This suffering occurs as a result of the harassment of other living entities. In this material body, endless onslaughts of suffering constantly disturb us. Since our position in these material bodies is very dangerous, we want protec- tion and shelter. We want to discover the escape route because, in time, the fire will totally absorb everything including our own existence. We are on fire due to our wild senses. If someone is on fire and comes into the environment, they can burn others or even ignite another object. When someone is too captured by sense gratification, they are just as dangerous as this fire, because they can ignite others or increase the fire like a contagious disease. However, this chanting of the holy name extinguishes the blazing fire of material suffering and material existence. One is literally on fire due to frustrations, anxieties and gloom, but the chanting of the holy name gives a cooling effect just as a sprinkler system pours water when smoke appears.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Spreading the Highest Benediction</h2><p>The next phrase, sreyah-kairava-candrika- vitaranam, means that the sankirtana movement spreads the highest benediction. We went from the blazing forest fire to the process of spreading the highest benediction through nama-sankirtana.</p><p class=translation>“Whole hearted chanting of Lord Krsna’s holy name is the highest goodness and munificence. Sreyah means ‘benediction’, kairava means ‘white lilies’, and candrika are ‘the rays of the moon.’”</p><p>In other words, the soothing rays of the moon affect the white lilies, which then blossom and become even more effulgent and beautiful. This refers to the chanting of the holy name. The white lily represents the devotional creeper and the rays of the moon represent the chanting, which gives nourishment to the creeper, making it beautiful and effulgent. In this way, the chanting spreads the highest benediction. Improper desires cannot lead to good fortune; however, once the anyabhilasa, or improper desires change, we move to this level.</p><h2 class=heading>The Life of All Transcendental Knowledge</h2><p>All of the topics of discussion from this first verse focus on congregational chanting, which results in these seven types of perfection. The fourth perfec- tion is vidya-vadhu-jivanam or the life of all tran- scendental knowledge. “The Mundaka Upanisad mentions two types of knowledge: material and transcendental.” Laukika vidya is material knowl- edge and para vidya is transcendental knowledge. Material knowledge gives information about the separated energies of the Lord:</p><div class=quote><p class=verse>bhumir apo ‘nalo vayuh kham mano buddhir eva ca ahankara itiyam me bhinna prakrtir astadha</p><p class=translation>"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego–all together these eight constitute My separated material energies."</p><p class=citation>Bhagavad-gita 7.4</p></div><p>The chanting gives us the life of all transcendental knowledge and the holy name contains all aspects of transcendence, far surpassing all material knowledge.</p><h2 class=heading>Increasing the Ocean of Transcendental Bliss</h2><p>The fifth perfection, anandambudhi-vardhanam, increases the ocean of transcendental bliss. Lord Caitanya does not refer to a puddle or a river, but specifically describes the chanting as a tremendous ocean of transcendental bliss for the living beings. “Only a vast expanse of water is called an ocean, nothing less; therefore unlimited bliss has been rightly compared to an ocean.”</p><h2 class=heading>Tasting Nectar at Every Step</h2><p>Number six, prati-padam purnamrtasvadanam, means that the chanting enables us to taste the nectar at every step. We can taste the nectar that always awaits us. The living entity perpetually feels anticipation, knowing that somewhere there is some- thing greater and even more wonderful. Although we have so many experiences, we often feel something is missing and hope for something sweeter. Just as a fish out of water cannot feel proper until it returns to its natural situation, a conditioned soul will not feel fully satisfied until it can also return to its natural position. Nama-sankirtana fulfills this purpose by enabling us to taste the nectar, which is available at every step.</p><h2 class=heading>Bathing the Living Entities</h2><p>The last line says <span class=sanskrit>sarvatma-snapanam</span> , which means the holy name completely bathes the body, the mind and the atma.</p><div class=translation>“The subtle and attendant gross contaminations upon the material conception of life have quite devoured the spiritual soul, but these material diseases can at once be terminated by chanting the holy name. When the soul released from his material designations is eager to reach Lord Krsna, he engages in devotional service under the cooling shade of Lord Krsna’s lotus feet.”<p class=citation>Sri Siksastaka, 15</p></div><p>Srila Jiva Gosvami writes in the Bhakti-sandarbha [273], and in the Krama-sandarbha:</p><div class=quote><p class=verse>ata eva yady apyanya bhaktih kalau kartavya tada kirtanakhya-bhakti-samyogenaiva</p><p class=translation>“This means that although it is required in Kali-yuga to practice the eight limbs of devotional service, they have to be performed in conjunction with chanting” (Sri Siksastaka, 15).</p></div><p>If a practitioner executes all the eight limbs which include sravanam, smaranam, pada-sevanam, arcanam, vandanam, dasyam, sakhyam and atma-nivedanam in conjuction with kirtana or the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, bhakti will fully manifest.</p><h2 class=heading>Questions & Answers</h2><p><span class=tag>Question:</span> Lord Caitanya spoke about the fire of material existence. Could you elaborate on this topic?</p><p><span class=tag>Answer:</span> Yes, it is simple. Often, the senses force one to act in direct opposition to the mind and intelligence. They are constantly stimulated and agitated due to contact with sense objects. Lord Caitanya along with Srila Prabhupada, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura all give this understanding and describe the senses as a blazing fire. We are in an emergency situation because a fire leads to devastation and destruction. The fire is intense and capable of burning everything in its path. The senses act in this way and have great power to agitate us.</p><p><span class=tag>Question:</span> Can this relate to the verse which describes how one is impelled to act sinfully as if by force?</p><p><span class=tag>Answer:</span> Yes. That is the lust. Lust actually causes the coverings but the contaminations such as improper desires, fruitive activities and even artifi- cial renunciation are all a part of lust. Love is proper and lust is the opposite of love, so Lord Caitanya has given us the key to convert lust into love—energy transference.</p><p><span class=tag>Question:</span> The vibration of the mantra is really an internal connection because if we watch someone hearing the mantra for the first time, they may like the beat or find themselves dancing and singing without even understanding the significance.</p><p><span class=tag>Answer:</span> This response may happen if they are pious. Some people hear the mantra and want to run away or even want to push the person down. Some people get so disturbed from this chanting; however, other people might hear the mantra and feel very inspired. Certain people hear the chanting and will continue singing the mantra throughout the entire day.</p><p><span class=tag>Question:</span> Are you saying that the chanting can actually invoke some demoniac energy?</p><p><span class=tag>Answer:</span> Yes. A very sinful person who comes into contact with anything related to transcendence will become angry, disturbed or bothered. On the other hand, a pious individual who sees a beautiful picture of Krsna will feel a sense of well-being and feel captivated or curious. Another individual might hear the holy name, see a picture of Krsna or hear of His qualities and pastimes, but become angry or even violent.</p><p><span class=tag>Question:</span> Could this negative reaction be a type of purging of the demoniac energy inside them? If they could just stay with it, would they get purified?{" "}</p><p><span class=tag>Answer:</span> Yes. If they stay, they will definitely get purified. We can compare the situation to a thief. If a thief is trying to rob the bank, the last person they want to see is the policeman. This would completely interfere with their entire program. Someone who wants to be God certainly wants to deny any knowl- edge in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The demonic want their own senses and desires to be supreme and want to have the power of the Godhead. Therefore, anything godly becomes threatening and disturbing, causing an inimical reaction.</p><p><span class=tag>Question:</span>This is a point that causes me trouble. On the one hand, I believe in my heart that at the core of our beings we are all eternal spirit souls, servants of Krsna, and loving entities. On the other hand, a part of me believes that some people walking around are just not right. I have a really hard time integrating or holding that belief, because I want to be able to see even the murderer as a pure soul who is really lost.</p><p><span class=tag>Answer:</span> That is a nice question and you have actu- ally already explained the answer yourself in the question. Ultimately, everyone is a part of God and the soul is pure but the problems arise due to the coverings. The main problem is penetrating the coverings.</p><p><span class=tag>Question:</span> Are there actually demons and Vais- navas? Are there souls that are just evil? Is that possible?</p><p><span class=tag>Answer:</span> There are demons, demoniac energy and demoniac influence. There are also saintly souls, saintly personalities and blessings from such personalities. Everything is personal, but there is the saktiman and the sakti or energy. Krsna is personal; however, He also has His different ener- gies such as bahiranga, tatastha, antaranga, etc. So, there are actual demons, and there are the negative energies or influences from those demons.</p><p><span class=tag>Question:</span> Can demons become devotees?</p><p><span class=tag>Answer:</span> No one is ever too deep in maya that they cannot be helped. Even the greatest demon cannot defeat Krsna’s love. No maya can be greater than Krsna. Even the most sinful and degraded individual can always be helped. However, at our state of awareness, we have to be able to perceive danger in certain associations. Although we want to be caring and loving, we can feel disturbed with people for their sinful actions or for actions that they perpetuate in others.</p><p><span class=tag>Question:</span> Since harinama-sankirtana is so important, why do our temples not engage in this process as much anymore? When I first joined, some devotees would actually go out every single day for sankirtana but now the devotees do not go out as much.</p><p><span class=tag>Answer:</span> Everything is connected to the idea of chanting the Lord’s name. Many devotees do not even chant japa. Other devotees have a fear about engaging in bhajana or kirtana together. As an introverted person, I experienced this myself but I act differently in the interest of service. However, until I became a sannyasi, I never danced in any kirtana. It was not in my nature to be so outgoing. Then I began to realize that the chanting and dancing is not an ordinary affair; rather, this activity is an offering to the Lord as well as a connection with souls. Even as a materialist, I just never danced. As a spiritualist, I thought, “What is this, all this moving and dancing around? What do they think, that spiritual life is some kind of wild disco? They’re blowing my cool! I just want to be meditative.” It just seemed too overt and unrelated to spiritual life but actually, every day I would see the pictures of Lord Caitanya with His hands raised, dancing and singing with drums and karatalas. Even this first sloka talks about dancing. However, Prabhupada would get disturbed if we danced too wildly, not due to ecstasy but due to improper consciousness. We have to be careful because sometimes the dancing gets a little “funky.” Devotees can even have accidents. Several years ago in Mayapur, some devotees were wildly throwing each other in the air during kirtana and actually hurt themselves.We should understand that the yajna for this age includes congregational chanting in front of the Deities, japa, bhajanas and harinama-sankirtana. By diving deeper into the idea of calling on Krsna’s name, we can make this aspect of the spiritual world more of a reality for us. In these pictures of Lord Caitanya, we always see drums, karatalas, singing and dancing. Basically, the spiritual world is an eternal party and one never tires of the eternal dance. Although we have different natures and incli- nations, the idea is that we should always chant the holy name in all the possible ways.</p><p>When we begin to minimize the most essential aspects of devotional life, we will start to substi- tute them with other forms of sense gratification and become again attracted to sensual stimulation. Srila Prabhupada has passed these specific formulas down through the Vaisnava line for a very special reason—the process works. When we minimize the process, we will gradually minimize different aspects of devotional life and soon lose the taste for chanting. We will lose the taste to see the Deities or to engage in any congregational activity. It is deli- cate. Minimizing certain activities makes it difficult to perform them on a regular basis. For instance, every day we shower as a natural habit, but if we get into the habit of showering one day a week, after a while it would become hard to return to our original standard of cleanliness. Once we fall into a pattern, it becomes more difficult to escape. Somebody may stop smoking but gradually begin again once a week and then twice a week. Once we make certain limits and follow them, they become regular parts of our lives. Of course this is hard due to the material body. It is hard to rise early in the morning and do anything. We might prefer to sleep until 9 o’clock or even sleep for 12 hours. There are only 24 hours in a day, which means that some individuals sleep half of their lives away. It is an austerity to wake up early, take a shower, chant japa and come to class. However, when we fall away from the routine, the program will become even harder to follow. Some devotees rarely come to the temple, only once or twice a week, and during the entire year they may only go into the temple room once or twice. Although they may appreciate the social association of the devotees, they lose the mood of really honoring the Deities and honoring the chanting of the holy name. They may come to a program and honor prasadam but fail to see the Deities. Soon, everything loses its importance and just the thought of involving them- selves more seems almost repulsive.</p><p>Maya plays many games. If we really want to learn, we can even learn from a new bhakta giving class. At the very least, the bhakta will read the verse and explain certain points from some level of sincerity. If we want to learn, we can learn. If we cannot hear from anyone except our guru or a sannyasi, it means that our hearing is very mediocre despite our own high opinion of ourselves. We are to be the servant of the servant. The next verses of the Siksastaka will explain that we should not want any number of followers or aspire after profit, distinction or adoration. We should be able to learn from even the ant. We have many different types of gurus to learn from in our environment. We can even learn from a sinful person by examining their nonsense and the terrible effects. If we are really sincere to learn, everything in the environment can teach us. When we miss the deep culture, we will only be able to hear or learn from certain situations or environ- ments. This is unfortunate.</p><p>We need to watch these kinds of patterns and try to appreciate the simplicity, purity and profun- dity of Krsna consciousness. These patterns can be very dangerous. We have all experienced different periods of ease and periods of difficulty, but once we begin to minimize the essential activities, maya will really attack. In boxing, one boxer may notice the other fighter weakening. At this point, he tries to deliver even more blows, because he sees that the opponent is weak. As soon as maya sees some weakness, she will immediately come in and finish us off. Maya sees a devotee not chanting their rounds, and this provides her with an opportune moment to bring in so many material desires and finish the devotee.</p><p><span class=tag>Question:</span> But why? Krsna made maya so why would He do that?</p><p><span class=tag>Answer:</span> Maya is actually Krsna’s great friend, great supporter and great servant. Krsna brings you in by calling you and maya has her own way to bring you in. Maya tries to beat you to ultimately push you towards Krsna and Krsna tries to call us. We can be stubborn and let maya beat us, or come to Krsna’s calling. It is all Krsna’s love.</p></div>
