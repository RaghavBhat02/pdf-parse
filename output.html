<span className="">“Oh my Lord, when will my eyes be 
</span><br>
<span className="">decorated with tears of love flowing con-
stantly when I chant Your holy name? When will 
my voice choke up and when will the hairs 
of my body stand on end at the recitation of 
Your name?”

<span className="">“Lord  Caitanya  Mahaprabhu  instructed  His  disciples  to  write 
books  on  the  science  of  Krsna,  a  task  which  those  who  follow 
Him  have  continued  to  carry  out  down  to  the  present  day.  The 
elaborations  and  expositions  on  the  philosophy  taught  by  Lord 
Caitanya  are  in  fact  most  voluminous,  exacting  and  consistent 
due to the system of disciplic succession. Although Lord Caitanya 
was widely renowned as a scholar in His youth, He left only eight 
verses,  called  Siksastaka.  These  eight  verses  clearly  reveal  His 
mission and precepts.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">—A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
</span><br>
<span className="">“Though  the  Siksastaka  Prayers  represent  the  spiritual  sciences 
at  their  most  complex,  Bhakti-Tirtha  Swami  explains  them  in  an 
almost  simple  way…  And  this,  of  course,  has  always  been  the 
Swami’s  forte:  He  explains  eternal  truths  in  a  way  that  enables 
a  contemporary  audience  to  appreciate  them.  He  opens  up  the 
doors  to  the  treasure  house  of  Vedic  wisdom,  and,  somehow, 
without diluting it, he gets us to walk in, to take off our coats and 
shoes, and to feel at home.”

<span className="">Foreword
</span><br>
<span className="">The  Siksastaka,  as  explained  in  this  book,  are 
</span><br>
<span className="">a  rare  and  confidential  series  of  eight  brief 
prayers—though  they  are  short,  these  verses  are 
able  to  change  your  life,  taking  you  from  the  most 
fundamental level of spiritual realization to the most 
exalted.  I  am  deeply  enlivened  that  His  Holiness 
Bhakti-Tirtha  Swami,  a  dear  friend  and  superlative 
Vaisnava,  has  chosen  to  comment  on  these  most 
important of theistic texts. He is eminently qualified 
to  do  so—years  of  practice  and  a  heart  filled  with 
devotion  have  given  him  invaluable  insights.  But, 
more,  he  has  a  spirit  that  acts  as  a  key,  a  key  that 
he  often  uses  to  unlock  the  mysteries  of  Caitanya 
Vaisnavism,  the  esoteric  essence  of  all  religious 
truth. As the Swami says in this book, he has delved 
into  these  prayers  “as  a  service  to  the  Vaisnava 
community.”
</span><br>
<span className="">“These prayers,” he continues, “contain volumes 
of  mysteries,  secrets  and  knowledge.  Just  as  the 
chanting  of  the  holy  name  contains  all  knowledge, 
the  spiritual  world,  and  rasa-tattva  [the  truth  of 
spiritual  relationship],  these  eight  prayers  contain 
everything.”
</span><br>
<span className="">It  is  an  interesting  manifestation  of  serendipity 
that I am called upon to write this foreword at this 
time:  Back  to  Godhead,  the  magazine  of  the  Hare 
Krsna movement, recently decided to print my five-
part  lecture  series  on  these  very  same Siksastaka 
Prayers (beginning with the March/April 2002 issue).

<span className="">Foreword
</span><br>
<span className="">But  this,  you  see,  is  Bhakti-Tirtha  Swami!  He  is 
clearly  a  mystic,  and  such  fortuitous  occurrences 
are not uncommon in his presence. This is why it is 
so  special  that  we  receive  a  commentary  on  these 
most special prayers from him: he is a most special 
person.
</span><br>
<span className="">He  lives  these  prayers  in  his  day-to-day  life. 
Just  as  Sri  Caitanya,  the  author  of  the  Siksastaka 
Prayers, entered into their mood so He could express 
them  with  clarity  and  vision,  so,  too,  does  Bhakti-
Tirtha  Swami  accentuate  the  need  to  enter  into 
these prayers on a personal level: “In the mood of a 
bhakta or devotee,” he says, “Lord Caitanya taught 
how to fully surrender and how to acquire Bhagavan 
through  the  process  of  bhakti,  or  pure  devotion. 
He  showed  that  bhakti  develops  from  bhakti  and 
cannot be controlled or regulated by anything other 
than  bhakti.  This  devotional  service  far  surpasses 
processes  such  as  jnana  or  empiric  philosophy, 
tapasya or austerity, and yajna or sacrifice.” Bhakti-
Tirtha  Swami  thus  establishes  the  need  to  walk  in 
the footsteps of Lord Caitanya, and, like the Lord, he 
describes bhakti as the highest path. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“This  Siksastaka  states  the  conclusion  of  Krsna 
consciousness,”  Bhakti-Tirtha  Swami  tells  us,  “and 
offers  the  culmination  of  all  the  Vedas;  therefore, 
it is the necklace that all Vaisnavas should wear. A 
necklace worn around the neck practically touches 
the  heart.  These  verses  are  essential  for  us  and 
should  be  kept  close  to  our  hearts.  They  should 
not  be  viewed  as  optional  or  as  an  extracurricular 
aspect of our spiritual life.”

<span className="">Reflections On Sacred Teachings, Volume One
</span><br>
<span className="">Though the Siksastaka Prayers represent the spir-
itual  sciences  at  their  most  complex,  Bhakti-Tirtha 
Swami  explains  them  in  an  almost  simple  way,  in 
a  way  that  allows  the  reader  to  enter  in.  In  other 
words,  he  makes  it  accessible:  “Each  sloka  [verse] 
distinctly  progresses  from  the  most  basic  levels  of 
consciousness to the ultimate expressions of love of 
Godhead. The first sloka emphasizes the process of 
congregational chanting. Number two discusses our 
ineptitude to take up chanting the holy name. Three 
provides a specific procedure for chanting the maha-
mantra. The fourth sloka focuses on the elimination 
of all unfavorable desires. The fifth deals with knowl-
edge of the jivas’ original spiritual identity, svarupa-
jnana.  Number  six  describes  how  the  living  entity 
will experience good fortune by coming closer to the 
Lord. The seventh verse shows the mood of separa-
tion  experienced  by  those  who  have  come  to  this 
topmost  platform.  This  is  vipralambha,  the  mood 
of  separation.  The  eighth  discusses  the  process  of 
obtaining  the  highest  perfection  or  altimate  goal 
called  prayojana.  From  these  eight  slokas  alone, 
we can already see the entire Nectar of Devotion.”
</span><br>
<span className="">And this, of course, has always been the Swami’s 
forte: He explains eternal truths in a way that enables 
a  contemporary  audience  to  appreciate  them.  He 
opens up the doors to the treasure house of Vedic 
wisdom, and, somehow, without diluting it, he gets 
us to walk in, to take off our coats and shoes, and to 
feel at home. Before long, we are immersed in Vedic 
knowledge, in a comfortable and down home kind of

<span className="">way. Soon after, we are ready to partake of a friendly 
dinner in the company of Vaisnavas, and that dinner 
is  comprised  of  the  most  succulent  fare:  bhakti. 
This book is a prime example of this phenomenon, 
and  so,  without  any  further  distraction,  I  ask  the 
Swami’s readers to enthusiastically dine on his most 
nectarian words.

</span><br>
<span className="">Author’s Preface
</span><br>
<span className="">The spiritual journey is simultaneously very simple 
</span><br>
<span className="">and complex. It is frightening and dangerous but 
at the same time extremely exciting and adventurous. 
We may often feel that we are traveling alone, but in 
fact  the  opposite  is  true.  Krsna  is  with  us  at  every 
moment  as  Paramatma,  situated  in  each  person’s 
heart.  He  also  descends  in  His  most  personal  and 
magnanimous  form  as  Lord  Caitanya,  where  He 
experiences  the  bhava  of  His  eternal  consort  and 
hladini-sakti  potency,  Srimati  Radharani.  In  this 
manifestation of Lord Caitanya, He presents Himself 
as a devotee for our benefit. It is not only Krsna that 
comes in so many lilas for the benefit of His devo-
tees  and  to  annihilate  and  expose  the  miscreants; 
many of His eternal associates frequent the material 
world to assist the Lord with His awesome missions. 
Our great acaryas are such associates. I have relied 
on  the  commentaries  of  two  of  our  acaryas,  Srila 
Bhaktivinoda  Thakura  and  Srila  Bhaktisiddhanta 
Sarasvati  Thakura  for  inspiration  for  my  reflections 
on the Siksastaka prayers.
</span><br>
<span className="">For  self-purification  and  as  a  service  to  the 
Vaisnava community, I have chosen to offer a brief 
commentary  on  the  eight  Siksastaka  prayers  by 
Lord  Caitanya.  These  prayers  are  extremely  impor-
tant in the life of the Vaisnava, and their mysteries 
continue to unfold as devotees reflect on them more 
and more. I originally presented the material in this 
book as a course for devotees at the Gita Nagari farm

<span className="">community in rural Pennsylvania during a Vaisnava 
Institute  gathering.  I  hope  this  small  offering  will 
help and encourage the readers to make a more in-
depth study of these great works for themselves. 
</span><br>
<span className="">The  Siksastaka  prayers  are  brief,  but  present 
eternal profound truths. They present information on 
states  of  consciousness  from  sambandha  through 
prayojana, and discuss obstacles to be avoided as 
well as achievements to be attained.
</span><br>
<span className="">By  the  mercy  of  Srila  Prabhupada  and  Lord 
Caitanya, even a lowly fool like myself can read such 
an extraordinary text and have the audacity to share 
a few ideas with others. I hope that you as readers 
will benefit from reflecting on these great verses as 
much or more than I have myself.

</span><br>
<span className="">Introduction
</span><br>
<span className="">This  Siksastaka  contains  two  very  common 
</span><br>
<span className="">words,  siksa  and  astaka.  Siksa  is  instruc-
tion  or  instructor  and  astaka  is  eight.  Therefore, 
Siksastaka  means  the  eight  instructions.  Out  of 
His  causeless  mercy,  Krsna  appeared  as  the  sum 
total of all knowledge known by the Vedas and gave 
this knowledge in an intimate and personal way. He 
arranged  to  have  many  agents  come  before  Him, 
with  Him,  and  after  Him  such  as  Srila  Prabhupada 
and the six gosvamis who wrote volumes of litera-
ture. Lord Caitanya did not write even one book or 
pamphlet, but left us only these eight prayers. Srila 
Prabhupada  discusses  this  interesting  fact  in  his 
different books and lectures:
</span><br>
<span className="">“Lord 
</span><br>
<span className="">Caitanya 
</span><br>
<span className="">Mahaprabhu 
instructed  His  disciples  to  write 
books on the science of Krsna, a task 
which  those  who  follow  Him  have 
continued  to  carry  out  down  to  the 
present  day.  The  elaborations  and 
expositions on the philosophy taught 
by  Lord  Caitanya  are  in  fact  most 
voluminous, exacting and consistent 
the  system  of  disciplic 
due 
succession.  Although  Lord  Caitanya 
was  widely  renowned  as  a  scholar 
in  His  youth,  He  left  only  eight 
verses, called Siksastaka. These eight

</span><br>
<span className="">verses clearly reveal His mission and 
precepts.” 
The Teachings of Lord Caitanya, xxiii
</span><br>
<span className="">These  prayers  contain  volumes  of  mysteries, 
secrets and knowledge. Just as the chanting of the 
holy  name  contains  all  knowledge,  the  spiritual 
world, and rasa-tattva, these eight prayers contain 
everything.  We  have  accepted  Krsna  conscious-
ness because we want to surrender and give up all 
anarthas or unnecessary impediments. We want to 
be  natural  and  allow  ourselves  to  understand  our 
original  svarupa  or  our  eternal  identities.  We  have 
accepted  the  understanding  that  something  exists 
far beyond what we have experienced consciously in 
this lifetime and in other lifetimes. We do not want 
to  just  enjoy  the  sakti,  or  the  energy  of  the  Lord; 
rather, we want to associate with the saktiman, or 
the energetic. Due to our distance from such asso-
ciation  in  these  material  worlds,  in  martyaloka, 
the  Lord  even  comes  Himself  at  different  times  to 
demonstrate the exact process to follow.
</span><br>
<span className="">The Mission of Lord Caitanya
</span><br>
<span className="">In  order  to  properly  appreciate  Lord  Caitanya’s 
message,  we  must  first  examine  the  unique  posi-
tion  and  mission  of  Lord  Caitanya  Mahaprabhu 
Himself. If a special person with an important posi-
tion brings a message, we can understand that the 
message must also be of great importance. In this 
case,  the  greatest  person,  the  Supreme  Person-

<span className="">ality of Godhead, has come in a unique way with a 
message.  Krsna  gives  these  Siksastaka  prayers  to 
us in His most magnanimous form as Lord Caitanya. 
namo  maha-vadanyaya  krsna-prema-pradaya 
te  krsnaya  krsna-caitanya-namne  gaura-tvise

and is actually Krsna in a special manifestation. The 
hladini-sakti  facilitates  Radharani  and  Krsna,  who 
are  actually  only  one  but  have  manifested  as  two 
for engaging in divine loving exchanges. They come 
together  in  this  material  world  as  Lord  Caitanya  to 
help us appreciate the intensity of devotion and love 
accessible for all living entities. By reflecting on Lord 
Caitanya’s  extraordinary  position,  we  can  better 
appreciate the exaltedness and profundity of His gift

</span><br>
<span className="">Among  Krsna’s  different  plenary  expansions, 
avataras,  and 
is 
particularly  special.  He  inaugurated  the  idea  of 
profusely  and  indiscriminately  distributing  knowl-
edge to all persons, worthy or unworthy. Sri Caitanya 
Mahaprabhu  came  as  a  devotee,  showing  us  how 
to  become  devotees  ourselves.  He  is  the  teacher 
and knows the message, but He acted as a student 
in  order  to  clearly  present  the  process  in  a  basic 
manner. As the supreme teacher, He established the 
yajna  or  sacrifice  for  this  age,  the  chanting  of  the 
Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Although previous Vais-
navas  had  established  this  maha-mantra  before 
Lord Caitanya’s appearance, He specifically reintro-
duced the chanting as the yuga-dharma for this age

<span className="">of Kali. He delivered the most esoteric knowledge in 
the  simplest  form  to  the  people  in  this  age  of Kali 
so  that  both  the  educated  and  uneducated  could 
understand.  Lord  Caitanya  made  Himself  avail-
able  by  bringing  the  highest  knowledge  down  to 
anyone capable of taking advantage of the message. 
Although  this  special  dispensation  of  the  highest 
knowledge  is  very  hard  to  acquire,  Krsna  makes 
it  available  in  order  to  give  everyone  a  chance. 
Throughout His mission, Lord Caitanya preached in 
many different places, inviting in all types of people 
from  other  paths,  even  mlecchas  and  mayavadis. 
Lord  Caitanya’s  design  and  order  is  to  spread  the 
message  in  every  town  and  village:  prthivite  ache 
yata nagaradi grama sarvatra pracara haibe mora 
nama. He did not want to limit the message to only 
a small percentage of the world or to only a certain 
class of people. He wanted it distributed indiscrimi-
nately.
</span><br>
<span className="">In  the  mood  of  a  bhakta  or  devotee,  Lord 
Caitanya  taught  how  to  fully  surrender  and  how  to 
acquire  Bhagavan  through  the  process  of  bhakti, 
or  pure  devotion.  He  showed  that  bhakti  develops 
from bhakti and cannot be controlled or regulated 
by  anything  other  than  bhakti.  This  devotional 
service  far  surpasses  processes  such  as  jnana  or 
empiric philosophy, tapasya or austerity, and yajna 
or sacrifice. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Lord Caitanya’s appearance fulfilled His desire to 
receive  His  own  dynamic  love  and  association  and 
to experience the mood of Radharani.  He  revealed

</span><br>
<span className="">the great love inherent in Srimati Radharani and the 
devotees, and He brought genuine dynamic love into 
this world. Caitanya Mahaprabhu exhibited the symp-
toms of mahabhava and prema and performed as 
the  supreme  Dancer  in  His  eternal  party.  Although 
we  can  never  fully  count  Lord  Caitanya’s  qualities, 
this  brief  description  of  His  exalted  activities  and 
nature  can  help  us  to  better  appreciate  the  signifi-
cance of His appearance.
</span><br>
<span className="">Our Place in History
</span><br>
<span className="">The  value  of  our  own  involvement  in  this  Hare 
Krsna movement should be clear in our conscious-
ness after hearing these extraordinary descriptions. 
We  must  recognize  that  Lord  Caitanya  is  a  special 
expression of Krsna. We should remember our posi-
tion  as  the  branches  of  Mahaprabhu’s  tree.  In  one 
sense,  all  of  our  projects,  temples  and  activities 
around the world are now a part of spiritual history. 
A  time  will  come  when  people  will  read  about  the 
history  of  the  Vaisnavas  on  this  planet  and  reflect 
on  the  various  events  and  achievements  that  have 
taken  place  in  the  ISKCON  movement  under  the 
banner  of  Lord  Caitanya.  Considering  that  He  has 
recently left, we can reflect on the significance of our 
presence  on  this  planet  at  this  particular  time.  As 
we deeply access all the amazing literatures, stories 
and  understandings  available,  we  can  begin  to 
realize the powerful treasure contained within these 
eight verses. We should recognize this valuable key 
that can open sacred doors to the spiritual world. As

</span><br>
<span className="">we  recite  these  slokas  daily,  we  should  constantly 
endeavor  to  enter  more  deeply  into  their  meaning 
and mystery. This Siksastaka states the conclusion 
of  Krsna  consciousness  and  offers  the  culmination 
of  all  the  Vedas;  therefore,  it  is  the  necklace  that 
all Vaisnavas should wear. A necklace worn around 
the neck practically touches the heart. These verses 
are essential for us and should be kept close to our 
hearts. They should not be viewed as optional or as 
an extracurricular aspect of our spiritual life.
</span><br>
<span className="">Levels of Relationship
</span><br>
<span className="">The  first  five  prayers  of  the  Sri  Siksastaka  deal 
mostly with sambandha -jnana, whereas six to eight 
describe prayojana. Abhidheya runs through each 
prayer.  Although  number  six  introduces  aspects  of 
bhava,  it  sometimes  falls  into  the  same  category 
as  seven  and  eight  which  give  aspects  of  prema. 
Sambandha-jnana is the position of establishing our 
relationship with the Lord. Abhidheya refers to the 
activities in this relationship and prayojana means 
the goal itself or love of God. All of our books and 
rituals touch on some of these aspects. Many scrip-
tures  try  to  help  us  accept  the  existence  of  a  God 
and teach basic ethics and morality, but certain rare 
scriptures, such as these, give deeper knowledge in 
relation to the activities of the spiritual world after we 
return to Krsna. This is transcendental culture. Reli-
gion does not give this aspect of the spiritual world; 
rather, it describes heaven and paradise as the ulti-
mate end. Actually, that is just the beginning of real

</span><br>
<span className="">life, which terminates in the spiritual world in direct 
association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
Once we are back in the association of the Lord, we 
will not just sit around; rather, there will be so many 
variegated spiritual activities. Then the real activity 
will begin. Our theology asks these questions: What 
do you do with God? What is the nature of the soul? 
What  happens  to  the  soul?  We  should  find  out  the 
nature of the activities in the spiritual world because 
maybe  we  will  not  want  to  return.  In  the  material 
world, even rich people suffer from boredom when 
they do not have any activities or engagements. They 
may live in wonderful environments or even in beau-
tiful  palaces  with  servants;  however,  without  some 
type  of  activities,  they  will  simply  become  bored 
and miserable. Life will become meaningless. Could 
this be the nature of the spiritual kingdom? Will we 
merely return to eternally do nothing? This would be 
like hell rather than a type of spiritual boon. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Each  sloka  distinctly  progresses  from  the  most 
basic levels of consciousness to the ultimate expres-
sions of love of Godhead. The first sloka emphasizes 
the  process  of  congregational  chanting.  Number 
two  discusses  our  ineptitude  to  take  up  chanting 
the  holy  name.  Three  provides  a  specific  proce-
dure  for  chanting  the  maha-mantra.  The  fourth 
sloka focuses on the elimination of all unfavorable 
desires. The fifth deals with knowledge of the jivas’ 
original  spiritual  identity,  svarupa -jnana.  Number 
six  describes  how  the  living  entity  will  experience 
good  fortune  by  coming  closer  to  the  Lord.  The

<span className="">seventh verse shows the mood of separation expe-
rienced  by  those  who  have  come  to  this  topmost 
platform. This is vipralambha, the mood of separa-
tion. The eighth discusses the process of obtaining 
the highest perfection or ultimate goal called prayo-
jana. From these eight slokas alone, we can already 
see the entire Nectar of Devotion.
</span><br>
<span className="">Chanting the Holy Names
</span><br>
<span className="">This  first  sloka  speaks  of  nama-tattva,  which 
emphasizes the process of chanting the holy names 
of the Lord. There are two types of chanting, silent 
chanting  or  japa,  and  congregational  chanting  or 
nama-sankirtana.  Many  pictures  of  Lord  Caitanya 
and  the  panca-tattva  show  Them  dancing  and 
chanting in villages with drums and karatalas. The 
Lord’s hands are raised as He sings and dances. It 
is  significant  that  this  first  offering  emphasizes  the 
importance  of  congregational  chanting.  Even  in 
common literature, readers and authors both know 
the  importance  of  a  strong  introduction  in  order 
to  catch  public  attention,  and  a  strong  finish  to 
leave the reader with a powerful impression. In this 
case,  Caitanya  Mahaprabhu  introduces  harinama-
sankirtana  as  number  one.  Srimad-Bhagavatam 
similarly  concludes  with  the  glories  of  congrega-
tional chanting.  As the intense discussion  between 
Sukadeva Goswami and Maharaja Pariksit concludes, 
the final verse encourages everyone to participate in 
this  process  of  nama-sankirtana.  This  conclusion 
to  Srimad-Bhagavatam  is  amazing.  Through  this

</span><br>
<span className="">analysis  of  the  holy  name,  we  can  also  appreciate 
that  our  spoken  words  or  vibrations  carry  direct 
connotations to the topics of our words. Therefore, 
we associate with the objects of our speech through 
our  sound  vibrations.  Considering  these  points, 
the  transcendental  sound  vibration  carries  us  that 
much  closer  into  the  association  of  the  Lord.  We 
are  prisoners,  incarcerated  by  the  maha-tattva  in 
these  material  forms.  The  sound  vibration  of  the 
holy  name  literally  penetrates  many  of  the  chains 
that have us shackled. Therefore, as the Lord’s first 
topic in the Siksastaka prayers and last message in 
the Bhagavatam, we can appreciate the importance 
of  nama-sankirtana.  Unfortunately,  it  is  extremely 
unusual  to  see  this  chanting  in  the  prison  of  the 
material world. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Whether  we  chant  the  names  of  God  through 
bhajana,  japa  or  sankirtana,  we  can  appreciate 
the  importance  of  this  practice.  Even  a  socio-
logical  examination  of  cultures,  especially  ancient 
cultures, will reveal a dance for every major event. 
Most  cultural  groups  have  a  dance  for  childbirth, 
for  weddings  and  even  for  funerals.  Singing  and 
dancing  have  a  spiritual  origin,  but  in  the  material 
environment these activities tend to revolve around 
the  senses.  Spiritual  dances  and  spiritual  songs 
are  intended  for  the  congregational  glorification  of 
God  as  an  offering.  We  are  literally  practicing  now 
for  our  return  to  the  Kingdom  of  God.  We  may  act 
without  much  realization,  but  if  we  act  with  some 
humility, gradually the devotional creeper will grow.

<span className="">Introduction
</span><br>
<span className="">Krsna  controls  everything,  maintains  everything, 
and ultimately destroys everything. However, in His 
most intimate form, He comes with His arms raised, 
singing and dancing as His own devotee to distribute 
the holy name in every town and village.
</span><br>
<span className="">Many  of  us  can  remember  the  first  time  we  saw 
devotees  chanting  and  dancing  in  the  streets;  an 
unusual sight for us. Watching the devotees marching 
through  downtown  or  along  some  chaotic  street  is 
extraordinary.  The  devotees  do  not  belong  to  the 
material world. This transcendental activity has little 
to do with the material patterns of society. Even our 
own experiences on harinama confirm this fact. If 
we are absorbed on the mental platform or in these 
material patterns, street chanting will be extremely 
hellish. We will simply think about our public image, 
or even feel anxious at the thought of seeing an old 
acquaintance. All kinds of thoughts can absorb the 
mind. Sankirtana almost forces us to become tran-
scendental, recognizing that the devotees are simply 
not  part  of  the  material  scheme.  Srila  Prabhupada 
brought this Krsna consciousness movement to the 
West  through  the  potent  process  of  sankirtana. 
When he arrived in this wretched place, the Western 
world,  he  very  nobly  but  humbly  sat  down  and 
simply  chanted  Hare  Krsna.  Through  the  power  of 
his  chanting,  people  gathered  and  some  accepted. 
The holy name affected the hearts of so many indi-
viduals. In the early days of this movement, temples 
started in this way with only a few devotees and little 
facility.  They  would  simply  go  into  the  streets  with

<span className="">the few available books at that time and chant the 
holy name. We can understand that this chanting is 
the yajna for this age of Kali. We no longer have to 
perform  yajnas  for  years  and  years  as  in  previous 
ages; we simply have to follow this joyful process of 
harinama-sankirtana.
</span><br>
<span className="">Devotional Processes for Each Age
</span><br>
<span className="">Nevertheless,  a 
</span><br>
<span className="">specific  yuga-dharma 
</span><br>
<span className="">is 
prescribed  for  each  age  according  to  the  nature 
of  the  people.  In  Satya-yuga,  meditation  was  the 
dharma or the primary way for people to gain real-
ization  and  purity  in  order  to  transcend  the  body 
and return to the spiritual world. Since Satya-yuga 
was  not  very  sinful  or  difficult,  meditation  was  the 
appropriate  religious  principle  of  the  age.  Without 
the  excessive  contamination  of  sin,  people  could 
easily  absorb  their  minds  in  deep  levels  of  realiza-
tion and enter into deep states of consciousness or 
trance to the point of even having contact with the 
Supersoul.  Then  they  could  receive  direction  and 
guidance  to  gain  freedom  from  the  material  world. 
In  Treta-yuga,  the  degradation  intensified  due  to 
more general patterns of sin that indicated the need 
for  another  type  of  yuga-dharma.  Of  course,  the 
holy  name  is  always  present  throughout  each  age 
but  not  with  the  same  emphasis  as  in  Kali-yuga. 
There  is  never  a  time  when  the  holy  name  is  not 
important, but due to the constitution of the people 
and  the  nature  of  the  environment,  other  yuga-
dharmas  were  prescribed.  Therefore,  yajnas  or

<span className="">Introduction
</span><br>
<span className="">sacrifices  were  emphasized  in  Treta-yuga  which 
required  a  serious  endeavor.  During  these  rituals, 
the  mantras  must  be  chanted  perfectly  in  order 
to  receive  the  results.  If  the  brahmanas  or  priests 
made  one  mistake,  they  would  bring  inauspicious-
ness to themselves and to others. Srila Prabhupada 
gave only the basic instructions to the brahmanas in 
ISKCON. If we performed all the rituals required of 
a brahmana, we would spend all day just preparing 
to  bathe,  eat  or  even  chant  gayatri.  Prabhupada 
gave  us  just  the  essence,  since  all  these  rituals 
would  overwhelm  us.  However,  in  Treta-yuga,  the 
rituals were performed in exact ways because of the 
nature of the environment. Since the residents had 
the ability to execute the rituals, they were expected 
to perform them. Furthermore, the people in Satya-
yuga lived for 100,000 years, in Treta-yuga 10,000 
years and in Dvapara-yuga 1,000 years.
</span><br>
<span className="">In  Dvapara-yuga,  the  process  or  dharma  was 
Deity worship. Temple worship entails many details, 
which can even now overwhelm a new pujari. Large 
temples  may  have  very  high  standards  and  even 
require  specific  cloth  to  dress  the  Lord,  special 
flutes  according  to  the  mood,  or  special  types  of 
turbans  and  crowns.  When  we  serve  the  Deities, 
we can either make offenses or perform the service 
nicely. Deity service is usually elaborate and is the 
way  to  fully  capture  the  mind  in  order  to  reinstate 
the  living  entity.  However,  someone  may  worship 
the  Deities  for  eight  or  ten  years  but  then  one  day 
become completely captured by maya. The potency

</span><br>
<span className="">of  our  temple  worship  depends  on  the  level  of  our 
consciousness  while  executing  the  service.  The 
mind fights against accepting. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Krsna makes Himself available in the arca-vigraha 
to  help  us  become  free  of  all  this  impersonalism 
and  voidism.  Nevertheless,  someone  might  touch 
or dress the Lord and even pray to Him directly, but 
Krsna  may  hide  from  them  because  in  Kali-yuga, 
these  activities  alone  are  not  sufficient—our  minds 
are captured by the dust of false ego and lust. There-
fore, in this age of Kali we have the chanting of the 
holy  names  of  the  Lord,  but  all  the  other  aspects 
are still present such as reflections or meditations, 
the  performance  of  yajnas  and  temple  worship. 
We  even  have  the  nine-fold  process  of  devotional 
service. Prahlada Maharaja explains in the Srimad-
Bhagavatam 7.5.23:
</span><br>
<span className="">sravanam kirtanam visnoh

form, 
qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes 
of  Lord  Visnu,  remembering  them, 
serving  the  lotus  feet  of  the  Lord, 
offering  the  Lord  respectful  worship 
with  sixteen  types  of  paraphernalia, 
offering prayers to the Lord, becoming

<span className="">His  servant,  considering  the  Lord 
one’s  best  friend,  and  surrendering 
everything unto Him (in other words, 
serving  Him  with  the  body,  mind 
and words)these nine processes are 
accepted as pure devotional service.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">However,  since  we  do  not  perform  any  of  these 
services  very  well,  we  should  engage  in  them  all 
and pray for mercy and grace. Lord Caitanya comes 
Himself  and  makes  one  last  arrangement  before 
Kalki  appears.  At  that  point,  the  only  way  to  help 
the people will be to force them out of their bodies 
because  their  senses,  minds,  intelligence  and 
bodies will have no desire to surrender to Krsna. The 
bodies are actually different in each age as well. The 
bodies  in  Satya-yuga  have  a  huge  size,  long  life, 
tremendous  intelligence  and  strength,  but  as  time 
passes  the  bodies  decrease  in  size  while  the  false 
ego increases. Nothing else increases in Kali-yuga 
except  the  false  ego.  People  become  less  inclined 
toward spiritual association and spirituality, the intel-
ligence and senses become duller, and the body size 
decreases. The entities in Satya-yuga would appear 
as giants to us. Despite all these reductions, the false 
ego continues to think, “I am most wonderful.” The 
less people have, the more the false ego tricks them 
into thinking that they are very special. For example, 
someone who is crazy may walk through the streets, 
disturbed and homeless, but view everyone else as 
crazy.  The  homeless  person  may  see  the  garbage

<span className="">cans  as  treasures  and  see  the  pedestrians  who 
ignore these treasures as crazy. Kali-yuga  will even-
tually become so pervasive that practically everyone 
will  become  crazy.  After  awhile,  the  only  hope 
for  the  people  will  be  to  remove  them  from  their 
bodies  since  communication  will  no  longer  help. 
Lord  Caitanya  comes  with  the  greatest  mercy  and 
then  Kalki  brings  mercy  in  another  form  by  taking 
the people out of their bodies in order to give them 
some elevation. We are currently in the stage where 
we have the holy names and the Siksastaka prayers 
that the Lord has broken down from the Vedas. He 
already  arranged  to  give  us  the  Mahabharata  and 
its essence, the Bhagavad-gita. He even broke the 
knowledge  down  in  the  Bhagavata  Purana,  which 
is the essence and ripened fruit of all the Puranas. 
Although the Lord has made so many arrangements, 
most  people  cannot  catch  up  with  the  process. 
Therefore, He breaks it down even further into these 
eight prayers and gives them Himself so that we can 
dive into them.
</span><br>
<span className="">These holy names can literally protect us against 
much of the voidism, impersonalism and sinfulness 
bombarding  our  minds  in  this  age  of  Kali.  Some-
times we may have to regroup by allowing ourselves 
to engage more in the congregational sharing of the 
names  of  God.  For  most  of  us,  this  chanting  may 
become a bit taxing when we are in maya because 
it can cause us to feel foolish. We can monitor our 
consciousness in this way because the more we feel 
foolish,  the  more  we  must  be  identifying  with  the

<span className="">material  energy.  If  we  feel  foolish  while  chanting 
Krsna’s  name  in  public  and  feel  conscious  of  the 
unlimited  eyes  scrutinizing  our  activities,  we  can 
understand the extent of our identification with the 
material energy.
</span><br>
<span className="">My Story
</span><br>
<span className="">Recently  the  devotees  discussed  the  different 
ways they joined the movement, and this led me to 
reflect  on  my  own  experience.  I  joined  this  move-
ment in an unusual way. I first saw the devotees in 
Boston  on  Harvard  Square.  It  was  extremely  cold, 
almost ten below zero, and these Hare Krsnas were 
bundled  up  on  the  street  corner  chanting.  There 
were  seven  or  eight  devotees  including  Satsvarupa 
Maharaja and some older devotees from the Boston 
temple.  At  this  time,  in  1970  or  1971,  I  had  been 
attending Princeton and was on my way to a game at 
Harvard. After returning several hours later, I noticed 
the devotees still chanting on the same street corner 
and thought that these people were either extremely 
crazy  or  had  something  incredibly  deep.  We  could 
barely  tolerate  the  outside  temperature  for  five  or 
ten minutes before running into a building or car for 
some heat. Despite the cold, they just kept chanting, 
dancing and even jumping. Just from their appear-
ance,  I  could  observe  something  very  unusual  and 
special. 
</span><br>
<span className="">I  had  been  visiting  different  yogis  and  spiritual-
ists, taking initiation from this guru and that guru. 
Anytime I heard of some guru or spiritualist, I would

<span className="">go  to  learn  and  take  initiation.  One  teacher  who 
instructed me for four or five years in the late 60’s 
taught me a variety of disciplines such as raja-yoga, 
hatha-yoga, astanga-yoga and other mystical prac-
tices.  Nevertheless,  he  always  told  me  that  he  was 
not my teacher or guru. I next met another teacher, 
Sri Chinmoy, joined his group, and took initiation in 
New York. After returning to my previous teacher, I 
told him, “Now I have met my guru and taken initia-
tion.”  He  laughed,  saying,  “This  teacher  only  has 
a  little  impersonal  realization  at  best  and  it  is  not 
what  you  think.”  I  replied,  “But  he  is  advertised  as 
the jagat-guru, the spiritual master of the universe.” 
He laughed and said, “The position of this particular 
personality is not something very serious.” Remark-
ably,  he  always  mentioned  Prabhupada’s  name  but 
I  simply  thought  that  Prabhupada  was  an  uncle 
or  some  friend.  Prabhupada’s  name  would  always 
come up as a reference when he explained different 
points.  When  I  returned  from  Sri  Chinmoy,  I  had 
been  excited  at  the  prospect  of  finding  my  guru 
but  extremely  disappointed  to  hear  that  he  also 
was not my teacher. One day he asked me, “Do you 
really  want  to  know  who  the  jagat-guru  is?”  and  I 
replied, “Yes, yes, yes, I really want to know.” Then 
he repeated more emphatically, “Do you really want 
to know?” Again I answered, “Yes.” Actually, he was 
cautioning me, realizing that my life would have to 
change  after  hearing  this  truth.  He  asked  one  last 
time, “Do you REALLY want to know?” I said, “YES.” 
He  finally  answered,  “The  spiritual  master  of  the

<span className="">Hare  Krsna  movement.”  “WHAT?”  I  asked,  “Those 
people who wear bed sheets and jump up and down 
in the streets with war paint on their faces?” I imme-
diately  remembered  the  first  time  that  I  saw  them 
on  harinama.  I  questioned  him,  “You  mean  that 
they  have  deep  philosophy  and  a  special  spiritual 
mentor?” He said, “Yes.” He explained Srila Prabhu-
pada’s position as the jagat-guru and  the spiritual 
master of spiritual masters. My teacher then began 
to  explain,  “When  Prabhupada  came  to  the  West, 
many  other  spiritual  leaders  who  knew  something 
of his level of excellence and position in the world 
should  have  assisted  him  in  his  mission.  I  have 
always  told  you  that  I  am  not  your  guru  because  I 
am  not.  These  teachings  never  deeply  excited  you 
because you are supposed to be involved in bhakti. 
Nevertheless, these things will help you in the future 
with the work you will have to do.”
</span><br>
<span className="">This completely astounded me because I always 
looked  for  truth,  and  now  this  particular  spiritual 
authority  informed  me  of  a  higher  truth  available 
in the Krsna consciousness movement. I tend to be 
extreme in whatever I do and try to do it intensely. 
This  new  dilemma  required  deep  reflection.  From 
my observation of the Hare Krsna devotees, I could 
understand that their practice was not some extra-
curricular, yogic experience. This required a commit-
ment  beyond  weekly  meetings  and  a  few  asanas. 
Following  these  Hare  Krsnas  would  mean  a  total 
shift in my lifestyle and mindset. I searched for ways 
to avoid dealing with the situation, unable to believe

</span><br>
<span className="">that  such  high  knowledge  could  be  found  among 
these strange people in the streets. After attending 
Princeton  and  preparing  for  a  career  in  the  United 
Nations, I could hardly accept that higher knowledge 
meant wearing a bed sheet, painting your face and 
jumping in the streets for the rest of your life. 
</span><br>
<span className="">This situation forced me to reflect on the value of 
my teacher. I knew this person for four or five years 
and he never lied to me. As a very powerful yogi, he 
had many faculties such as the ability to read minds 
and  see  into  the  future.  I  began  reflecting  on  his 
previous instructions which all proved to be correct. 
I  could  not  just  reject  this  instruction,  especially 
since he did not try to claim me and had helped me 
previously  in  many  ways.  I  then  decided  to  go  and 
study the Krsna people just to prove that they did not 
have any higher truth. This was the only way that I 
felt capable of dealing with the situation at that time. 
I began visiting the New York temple simply to find 
fault  in  order  to  comfortably  close  that  chapter  of 
my life. In this way, I could somehow find a means 
to  later  reject  that  teacher  and  continue  with  my 
extracurricular yogic practices elsewhere. During my 
visits at the temple, I began to learn and understand 
more  about  harinama  and  Krsna  consciousness 
but  asked  numerous  questions  after  the  classes, 
still trying to find fault. I also bought and read many 
books simply to find fault. From the books and from 
my  observation  of  the  devotees,  I  began  to  appre-
ciate that they had a powerful philosophy. From my 
first two or three days at the temple, I could under-

</span><br>
<span className="">stand  that  there  were  different  types  of  devotees, 
some were genuine and some were not. From those 
devotees  who  seriously  followed  the  philosophy, 
I  could  understand  the  power  of  their  teachings. 
The more I studied, the more I challenged, which of 
course is the nature of Krsna consciousness. As the 
investigation deepens, the power of the philosophy 
shines  through.  Since  I  could  not  get  around  this 
knowledge, I joined.
</span><br>
<span className="">Seek Special Mercy
</span><br>
<span className="">This  story  again  emphasizes  the  power  of  the 
congregational  chanting  of  the  holy  name—an 
unusual  activity  for  this  material  world.  My  experi-
ence  also  shows  Krsna’s  many  ways  to  keep  away 
certain living entities who are not properly situated or 
ready to take advantage of the philosophy. Although 
this  philosophy  is  for  everyone,  one  must  have  a 
certain  amount  of  ajnata-sukrti  or  at  least  special 
mercy in order to directly participate. Without these 
factors,  the  average  person  on  the  planet  cannot 
come close despite the availability of the philosophy. 
Many individuals will receive some benediction from 
taking prasadam or hearing the holy name but they 
will not be able to come so close. Many aspects of 
the  philosophy  will  simply  bewilder  them,  such  as 
maha-visnu’s  activities  of  creation.  The  scriptures 
describe that He lies down on the Causal Ocean and 
unlimited  universes  emanate  from  His  body  as  He 
breathes in and out. As He inhales and exhales just 
once,  trillions  and  trillions  of  years  pass.  Beyond

</span><br>
<span className="">these unbelievable activities, He appears in different 
incarnations as blue, yellow, white and green. Then 
we hear of Lord Brahma, a small attendant of Lord 
Visnu  who  has  four  heads  and  lives  for  311  trillion 
years. Lord Siva, another attendant, actually dances 
to  destroy  the  universe.  We  hear  that  God  comes 
as Matsya, the fish avatara, as Kurma, the tortoise 
avatara, and even as Lord Varaha, a boar avatara. 
The reality of this philosophy is absolutely phenom-
enal.  These  teachings  are  completely  outside  of 
normal  consciousness,  showing  both  the  difficulty 
as well as the exalted level of such philosophy. Now 
consider how we, as devotees, have accepted all of 
these  extraordinary  things.  We  accept  that  every 
morning we receive great benediction and blessings 
from dancing around a little tree and putting a few 
drops  of  water  on  the  dirt.  This  is  amazing.  Lord 
Caitanya has descended to show us how to become 
devotees,  understanding  the  difficulties  for  the 
conditioned souls who are captured by the material 
energy. Our senses and minds will remain blocked 
unless  we  receive  this  extra  help.  In  my  case,  my 
mind would have been blocked so Krsna just tricked 
me and arranged to bring me through the back door. 
I  had  to  go  through  all  this  psychological,  psychic 
and mental jugglery to finally come to the point of 
accepting this deeper truth and simply appreciating 
bhakti.
</span><br>
<span className="">As  we  examine  our  individual  lives,  we  notice 
that  Krsna  arranged  the  exact  situation  necessary 
for each of us to make a connection to this process.

<span className="">Introduction
</span><br>
<span className="">Maybe your best friend started coming, your husband 
or wife brought you along, or you just happened to 
get a book at a specific time. For others, you began 
to feel existential, questioning everything, and then 
you  happened  to  meet  the  devotees  or  hear  them 
speak. So many different circumstances are possible 
but Krsna arranges the necessary situations for each 
individual.  The  distribution  of  the  holy  name  actu-
ally gives devotional credits to many individuals who 
either have no credits or who lack sufficient credits 
to make the connection. Although there are so many 
people and so many temples, only a few will come 
for  darsana  of  the  Deities.  Consequently,  we  must 
use  the  other  methods  to  bring  the  Deities  to  the 
people or bring the Deities’ mercy to the people in 
the form of prasadam or the holy name. In this way, 
we  can  extend  ourselves  and  extend  the  mercy  of 
the Lord. Lord Caitanya eagerly wants to make this 
process  more  available,  especially  for  the  unquali-
fied.  Therefore,  His  very  first  presentation  from 
His  great  treasure,  the  Siksastaka  prayers,  refers 
directly to the holy name of the Lord.
</span><br>
<span className="">The Process of Devotional Service
</span><br>
<span className="">Srila  Bhaktivinoda  Thakura  and  Srila  Bhaktisid-
dhanta  Sarasvati  Thakura  also  have  many  impor-
tant  points  to  share  on  these  eight  slokas  and 
on  harinama-sankirtana.  Srila  Bhaktivinoda  has 
probed the profundities of these prayers through his 
Sri Sanmodana Bhasyam or commentary to the Sri 
Siksastaka  and  Srila  Bhaktisiddhanta  has  further

<span className="">elaborated  on  these  aphorisms  through  his  own 
vivrti or commentary. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta states:
</span><br>
<span className="">“There  are  innumerable  ways  to 
execute devotional service; the Srimad-
Bhagavatam and the Hari-bhakti-vilasa 
have described many of them. Broadly 
speaking,  some  sixty-four  limbs  of 
devotional  service  are  considered 
the  main  disciplines  or  processes 
of  bhakti-yoga.  They  are  all  grouped 
under  the  categories  of  vaidhi-bhakti 
(devotional service according to rules 
and  regulations)  and  raganuga-bhakti 
(spontaneous  devotional  service). 
In 
Prahlada 
Maharaja  especially  glorifies  pure 
spontaneous  devotional  service.  As 
Lord  Gaurasundara  has  said:  ‘The 
congregational  chanting  of  the  holy 
name of the Lord is the most perfect 
form of devotional service.’” 
</span><br>
<span className="">Srimad-Bhagavatam, 
</span><br>
<span className="">Sri Siksastaka, 11-12
</span><br>
<span className="">These  64  tenets  are  the  activities  in  devotional 
service, which will gradually bring us to the stages 
of  bhava  and  prema.  Of  these  64  angas,  Srila 
Bhaktisiddhanta  explains  the  chief  importance  of 
nama-sankirtana. These points can help us better 
appreciate  that  Srila  Prabhupada  inaugurated  this 
Hare  Krsna  movement  through  the  usage  of  this

<span className="">particular spiritual weapon, sankirtana. Srila Bhak-
tisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura continues:
</span><br>
<span className="">“Imperfect  chanting  of  Krsna’s 
name is unable to cause the optimum 
spiritual change in the living entities. 
This  will  lead  them  to  doubt  the 
potency  of  kirtana.  Therefore,  let 
the  complete  and  perfect  chanting 
of  Krsna’s  holy  name,  or  nama-
sankirtana, be victorious...By chanting 
the  name  of  Sri  Krsna,  one  achieves 
supra-mundane  perfection.  Seven  of 
the  perfections  specially  related  to 
chanting Lord Krsna’s holy name are 
mentioned in this sloka.”

<span className="">bliss, and it enables us to fully taste 
the  nectar  for  which  we  are  always 
anxious.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">The  first  phrase,  ceto-darpana-marjanam, 
means the cleansing of the mirror of the heart. Srila 
Bhaktisiddhanta  explains  that  the  dust  of  material 
contamination  thoroughly  covers  the  mirror  of  the 
heart  of  the  conditioned  soul,  but  the  chanting  of 
Lord  Krsna’s  name  cleanses  this  mirror.  The  heart 
is  a  very  special  organ  in  the  body.  It  is  phenom-
enal  that  the  heart  pumps  nearly  2,000  gallons  of 
blood  in  one  day.  Furthermore,  the  soul  resides  in 
the same region as the heart. When people undergo 
heart  transplants,  they  often  experience  altera-
tions  in  their  personalities.  These  changes  appear 
distinctly  in  some  people  since  the  consciousness 
is  seated  in  the  heart  area  and  the  subtle  energy 
is  constantly  circulated  throughout  the  body  by 
the  blood.  Blood  transfusions  can  also  result  in 
alterations  of  consciousness.  Even  the  clothes  of 
another person subtly carry their energy. People are 
constantly engaged in energy transfers. We pick up 
different  energies  simply  by  walking  into  another 
house  or  environment.  For  instance,  the  Bhaga-
vatam explains that if one eats in a sinful place, one 
will  pick  up  some  of  the  sin  from  the  atmosphere. 
The thoughts and actions of people permeate their 
environments.  The  consciousness  of  the  cooks 
enters  the  food  and  especially  the  grains.  We  do 
not have to wonder why people experience so much

</span><br>
<span className="">trouble in the material energy. Everywhere they turn, 
they constantly get “zapped.” Fast food restaurants 
are even more mechanical and gross due to the type 
of ingredients, and especially due to the conscious-
ness of the cooks who usually receive only minimum 
wage and hate their jobs. Furthermore, the environ-
ment is filled with passionate people who are angry, 
disturbed, frustrated, lusty and depressed. Then, you 
enter and sit in the middle of this energy while the 
waiter or waitress brings you a plate of sin. Although 
they  may  smile  at  you  and  say,  “Enjoy,”  they  are 
simply  thinking,  “Get  out  of  here!”  They  have  just 
served  100  people  and  feel  exhausted.  Although 
they ask how you enjoyed your meal, they just want 
to see your tip, and if you left only a small amount, 
they practically curse you as you walk out the door. 
They angrily think to themselves, “You took all of my 
time and simply see me as your slave. What can I do 
with this tip? I cannot even put gas in my car with 
this!”  Consequently,  the  sin  from  the  environment 
completely weighs you down; therefore, we need to 
chant the holy names, which cut away at the atmo-
sphere and eradicate heavy contamination.
</span><br>
<span className="">The contamination we pick up from these different 
environments must be cleansed. We constantly pick 
up something from our environment just as we may 
pick  up  a  cold  or  flu  on  the  bus  or  train.  Often  we 
travel  around  in  contaminated  airplanes,  which 
pack  hundreds  of  people  into  one  little  space  for 
hours.  Their  mentalities  and  anxieties  come  from 
all  different  places  and  just  bounce  off  the  walls

<span className="">back onto us. These airplanes even subject us to the 
unnatural  consequences  of  radiation,  electromag-
netic effects, and the pressure from accelerating and 
decelerating. The body was not designed to ascend 
to  such  heights  or  descend  so  rapidly.  The  more 
modern airplanes have started to re-circulate the air 
for efficiency, which means that the older planes are 
actually healthier than the more modern ones. Some 
pilots  are  becoming  impotent  due  to  that  atmo-
sphere  and  have  even  filed  lawsuits.  Considering 
these artificial impositions, we can understand how 
such  situations  lead  to  airport  rage,  school  rage, 
road rage, office rage and even executive rage. When 
someone  enters  their  office,  they  see  computers 
and  machines  everywhere!  It  seems  that  people 
are becoming more and more disturbed, especially 
in  America  and  Europe.  Much  of  the  disturbances 
result from electromagnetic influences. For example, 
in countries like South Africa and Japan, practically 
everyone has a cell phone. Even a small five-year-old 
girl may make a few phone calls and ask, “What kind 
of candy does the store in your neighborhood sell? 
I don’t like the candy from this store.” It is amazing 
to see everyone with personal phones. Although we 
use all these fax machines, computers, cell phones 
and  other  electromagnetic  appliances,  we  should 
understand that they are not natural and even affect 
our  nervous  system  and  our  minds.  This  energy 
bombards people’s existence, causing them to feel 
more  tense,  anxious  and  passionate.  Many  people 
will  even  develop  sicknesses,  which  are  difficult  to 
repel, due to this energy.

</span><br>
<span className="">Protecting Ourselves with the Holy Name
</span><br>
<span className="">The  holy  names  help  to  cleanse  us  of  all  these 
contaminations  constantly  attacking  us.  When 
someone approaches us with a mundane conversa-
tion and speaks offensively or gossips, it is as if they 
are  dumping  a  barrel  of  garbage  on  us.  Devotees 
communicate about everything, but if a relationship 
only involves dumping garbage, just ask the person: 
“I am glad to share, but can we take the conversa-
tion  to  a  higher  level?”  If  they  continue  to  share 
such garbage, we really have to endeavor to cleanse 
ourselves,  which  requires  a  good  amount  of  time 
and energy. If we constantly get dumped on at work, 
on  the  streets  while  preaching,  at  home  or  else-
where,  we  can  expect  that  our  consciousness  will 
feel very dismal. We will even lose excitement about 
the devotional process. Some of the assaults will be 
unavoidable because, as we move about in different 
environments,  people  will  attack  us  consciously  or 
unconsciously. Everything involves the socialization 
of  energies.  For  this  reason,  even  one  moment  in 
the association of very advanced souls can cleanse 
us  to  such  an  extent  that  it  plants  a  seed  that  can 
nourish us and help us eternally with our growth. You 
may feel surcharged after visiting different places of 
pilgrimage or after receiving nice senior association. 
You  will  feel  different  for  a  few  days  because  they 
actually affect the atmosphere by bringing cleansing 
and clarification. Their presence helps to make alter-
ations  in  what  you  are  carrying  and  what  you  are 
experiencing. However, as time passes, the regular

<span className="">contamination  begins  to  bombard  you  again  and 
you  return  to  business  as  usual.  When  the  senior 
devotees  come,  everyone  is  on  their  best  behavior 
and  even  smile  at  each  other  although  sometimes 
they  cannot  stand  one  another.  They  think,  “I  can 
handle this for a week during their  visit.” Then, for 
one week, everyone comes to the morning program 
and  chants  together.  Actually,  the  senior  devotees 
make  a  difference  when  they  come  because  they 
bring a different kind of energy into the atmosphere. 
For  this  reason,  we  need  to  be  more  mindful  in 
order to capture the full presence and blessings of 
the senior devotee, the presence of our guru, and to 
even more deeply capture the presence of what we 
read. We want to maintain these reflections so that 
they always stay with us.
</span><br>
<span className="">Sometimes you may listen to a stimulating lecture, 
which  helps  you  feel  better  in  your  services.  You 
need to hold onto these reflections and let them live 
with you, not only for that moment, but constantly, 
so that they bring solace. These reflections can help 
you feel more cared for and protected, and help you 
understand  the  purpose  of  all  the  different  types 
of  austerities.  These  are  actually  heavy  austerities. 
We  are  in  the  minority—everyone  around  us  acts 
and  speaks  differently.  Therefore,  when  we  attend 
class  or  read  from  the  scriptures,  we  should  try  to 
be mindful in order to absorb and imbibe the knowl-
edge into our being. Then, when the bombardments 
face us, they will not affect us to the same degree. 
We will have the ability to shake them off. When we

<span className="">spend extensive time in the city, we become accus-
tomed  to  the  air  pollution,  the  noise  pollution  and 
the electromagnetic pollution. However, if we spend 
some time in a rural environment and later return to 
the city, we will experience quite a difference. Some 
people work with different types of healing and are 
sensitive to the energies; therefore, they can identify 
those people who live in the cities due to the extra 
tension  in  the  muscles  and  in  the  nervous  system. 
This  tension  results  from  their  day-to-day  experi-
ences.  Prabhupada  said  that  the  cities  are  in  the 
mode  of  passion,  while  the  rural  areas  are  in  the 
mode of goodness. An environment helps to create 
a  certain  level  of  consciousness,  and  although  we 
can  avoid  some  of  the  influences,  in  general  the 
environment  can  capture  us.  For  this  reason,  it  is 
good for those who live in the cities to take a walk 
in the park or forest or even visit a farm in order to 
leave  these  heavy  energy  exchanges.  We  can  even 
see  how  people  will  unconsciously  park  their  cars 
close  to  water,  trees  or  greenery  just  to  cool  off. 
They may feel so uptight or anxious but the change 
in atmosphere seems to have a cleansing effect on 
them since it lacks the dominant presence of Kali-
yuga.  We  see  that  Krsna  lives  in  Vrndavana.  The 
gopas do not go out to the factories, but they go to 
the forest and take care of the cows. It is not only a 
simple life but also a natural life.

<span className="">Cleansing the Mirror of the Heart  
</span><br>
<span className="">energy  constantly  bombards  us  should  help  us  to 
understand the contamination present on the mirror 
of  our  hearts.  Just  imagine  a  mirror  completely 
covered  by  dust.  Normally  we  can  see  our  own 
image  in  a  mirror,  but  the  dust  brings  obfuscation 
and  prevents  us  from  seeing  our  own  reflection 
clearly.  This  dust  covers  the  soul.  “Chanting  Lord 
Krsna’s name cleanses the mirror of the conditioned 
soul’s  polluted  heart,  which  is  wholly  covered  by 
three contaminations, namely material desires, the 
enjoying spirit, and ungodly atheistic activities” (Sri 
Siksastaka, 13). In other words, the dust that covers 
the  soul  comes  in  three  forms  and  keeps  the  soul 
conditioned. This first type of dust is anyabhilasa, 
or desires separate from Krsna’s desires. The living 
entities  that  have  become  adverse  to  the  Lord  are 
filled with desires separate from the interest of God. 
Phala-bhoga,  the  second  type  of  dust,  means  the 
enjoyment  of  worldly  activities,  or  attachment  to 
worldly or fruitive activities along with their results. 
The third covering, phala-tyaga, is almost the oppo-
site. Phala-tyaga means that one practices renuncia-
tion but not for the pleasure of the Lord. One can be 
improperly attached but one can also be improperly 
renounced. Not only can improper desires cover us 
over  with  improper  activities  and  attachments,  but 
they  can  also  cause  us  to  unnecessarily  renounce 
certain  things  or  renounce  with  the  wrong  inten-
tions. One may practice renunciation just for glory, 
distinction  and  adoration,  or  engage  in  tapasya 
simply  for  power.  Even  Ravana  and  Jarasandha

<span className="">were  very  powerful.  They  both  performed  many 
different  types  of  rituals  but  for  improper  reasons. 
Both  improper  attachment  and  improper  renuncia-
tion can contaminate the heart. Our activities must 
be  performed  with  the  proper  consciousness  and 
with  the  proper  goals.  As  previously  described, 
these three contaminations of dust cover the mirror 
of  our  heart  and  cause  our  conditioning.  However, 
the chanting cleanses the heart of all the dust accu-
mulated after years and years of such conditioning. 
“These treacherous contaminations cover the mirror 
of  consciousness  and  cause  the  jiva  to  reject  his 
true nature” (Sri Siksastaka, 13). Such contamina-
tions are different types of deceit or kaitava which 
cover  the  jiva’s  actual  vision  of  its  true  identity. 
Once this dust is cleansed away, the vision and the 
natural activities of the soul can be fully expressed. 
Only then will we completely appreciate our position 
as Krsna’s servants. At this point, we become all for 
Krsna and Krsna becomes all for us.
</span><br>
<span className="">While  we  chant  these  prayers  each  morning, 
we  should  simultaneously  reflect  on  these  points 
since  the  eight  verses  literally  contain  everything 
necessary  to  become  fully  Krsna  conscious.  We 
read many books and engage in so many activities 
mainly to help us control the mind, but these eight 
slokas  contain  everything.  Lord  Caitanya  did  not 
write  many  books  because  there  was  actually  no 
need. He came to give the highest truth in the most 
simplistic,  direct  and  potent  way.  If  we  perform  a 
daily or periodic exercise of trying to go deeper and

</span><br>
<span className="">Cleansing the Mirror of the Heart  
</span><br>
<span className="">deeper  into  the  meaning  of  these  slokas,  we  will 
discover  that  everything  else  we  can  read  about, 
hear about or experience is contained within them. 
We need to learn so much since our minds and intel-
ligence  are  such  rascals.  We  actually  want  to  trick 
the  mind  and  intelligence  by  occupying  them  with 
devotional  thoughts  and  reflections  while  under-
going the cleansing process. To the extent that our 
minds  and  intelligence  are  strong  and  powerful, 
we  must  learn  to  tame  the  wild  mind  just  as  one 
tames a wild horse. If a wild horse is not tamed, it 
will knock everything down, kick everyone and even 
run away. Due to its wild nature, it must come under 
great  surveillance  and  monitoring  until  it  decides 
to cooperate and recognize its boss. We have to go 
through  so  many  rituals  and  study  simply  because 
our  intelligence  is  devious  and  hyperactive.  f  we 
just  chant  the  holy  name  with  purity  and  potency, 
everything will be revealed. However, sometimes we 
have to hear more and even undergo certain expe-
riences  in  order  to  take  deeper  shelter  of  the  holy 
name.  Ultimately,  in  Krsna  consciousness  we  only 
need the maha-mantra, but before we can chant the 
names of Radha and Krsna and chant this message 
imported from the spiritual world, golokera prema-
dhana hari-nama-sankirtana, we have to build up 
so much. From this perspective, we can realize what 
goes on in Krsna consciousness. Living entities from 
time  immemorial  have  been  finding  expert  ways 
to deny reality, expert ways to run away from their 
real identity and expert ways to minimize and deny 
Krsna’s  love.  Krsna  arranges  through  scriptures,

</span><br>
<span className="">sadhus, gurus, plenary expansions, partial plenary 
expansions, 
incarnations,  avataras,  and  even 
through  His  own  personal  presence  to  somehow 
encourage us to give up the unnecessary and reach 
out for the obvious truth we hide from.
</span><br>
<span className="">For these reasons, Lord Caitanya comes Himself. 
Advaita  Acarya  and  Narada  Muni  call  Him,  letting 
Him  know  that  this  is  a  serious  time.  The  rascals 
in  Kali-yuga  need  special  mercy  because  they  will 
not expend the effort to meditate, and even if they 
do,  their  minds  will  be  everywhere.  They  will  not 
be fixed in temple worship or yajnas, and although 
they will pretend, their minds will be in other places. 
Consequently,  the  Lord  gives  a  process  that  can 
still benefit the people despite the wandering mind. 
Although the mind, the will and the emotions are all 
over the place, somehow there will still be a chance 
for  advancement.  Just  by  chanting  the  holy  name 
in  various  environments,  even  those  who  have  no 
interest  can  receive  benedictions.  Even  those  who 
are not very serious can still act as ambassadors to 
spread  the  chanting  of  the  holy  names.  Therefore, 
as they chant, they purify themselves and other enti-
ties while distributing the mercy to those who may 
be more destitute or insane than them. In this way, 
everyone  will  receive  some  blessings.  Everyone  on 
this planet is very fortunate due to the availability of 
the holy names, but some may take full advantage 
and be able to return to the spiritual kingdom. While 
repeating  this  verse,  we  can  reflect  on  the  mirror 
conception  and  the  need  to  cleanse  the  dust  from 
the mirror or heart.

<span className="">Cleansing the Mirror of the Heart  
</span><br>
<span className="">Extinguishing the Fire of Material Existence
</span><br>
<span className="">The  second  phrase,  bhava-maha-davagni-
nirvapanam,  means  extinguishing  the  blazing 
forest  fire  of  material  existence.  The  senses  are 
on  fire  and  this  material  world  is  burning  due  to 
the  many  different  types  of  suffering.  The  living 
entities  in  this  material  world  experience  three 
different  types  of  suffering  called  adhyatmika, 
adhidaivika,  and  adhibhautika.  Adhyatmika 
refers to the suffering caused by one’s own mind. 
Then  one  suffers  adhidaivika;  miseries  caused 
by the demigods in the form of heat, cold, earth-
quakes,  tornados,  hurricanes,  etc.  Finally,  one 
suffers  endless  miseries  from  other  living  enti-
ties,  adhibhautika.  Even  from  a  small  mosquito 
bite, we can undergo so much suffering and even 
die.  During  one  trip  to  Africa  I  became  very  ill.  I 
traveled  to  Botswana  to  have  a  meeting  with  the 
President of the country and nearly died from one 
little mosquito with malaria. My whole system was 
completely thrown off due to fever, weakness and 
hallucinations.  This  suffering  occurs  as  a  result 
of  the  harassment  of  other  living  entities.  In  this 
material  body,  endless  onslaughts  of  suffering 
constantly disturb us. Since our position in these 
material bodies is very dangerous, we want protec-
tion and shelter. We want to discover the escape 
route because, in time, the fire will totally absorb 
everything  including  our  own  existence.  We  are 
on  fire  due  to  our  wild  senses.  If  someone  is  on 
fire  and  comes  into  the  environment,  they  can 
burn  others  or  even  ignite  another  object.  When

</span><br>
<span className="">someone is too captured by sense gratification, they 
are just as dangerous as this fire, because they can 
ignite  others  or  increase  the  fire  like  a  contagious 
disease.  However,  this  chanting  of  the  holy  name 
extinguishes  the  blazing  fire  of  material  suffering 
and material existence. One is literally on fire due to 
frustrations, anxieties and gloom, but the chanting 
of  the  holy  name  gives  a  cooling  effect  just  as  a 
sprinkler system pours water when smoke appears. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Spreading the Highest Benediction
</span><br>
<span className="">The  next  phrase,  sreyah-kairava-candrika-
vitaranam,  means  that  the  sankirtana  movement 
spreads the highest benediction. We went from the 
blazing  forest  fire  to  the  process  of  spreading  the 
highest benediction through nama-sankirtana. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“Whole  hearted  chanting  of  Lord 
Krsna’s  holy  name  is  the  highest 
goodness  and  munificence.  Sreyah 
means  ‘benediction’,  kairava  means 
‘white  lilies’,  and  candrika  are  ‘the 
rays of the moon.’” 
</span><br>
<span className="">Sri Siksastaka, 14
</span><br>
<span className="">In  other  words,  the  soothing  rays  of  the  moon 
affect  the  white  lilies,  which  then  blossom  and 
become  even  more  effulgent  and  beautiful.  This 
refers  to  the  chanting  of  the  holy  name.  The  white 
lily  represents  the  devotional  creeper  and  the  rays 
of  the  moon  represent  the  chanting,  which  gives

</span><br>
<span className="">nourishment  to  the  creeper,  making  it  beautiful 
and effulgent. In this way, the chanting spreads the 
highest  benediction.  Improper  desires  cannot  lead 
to good fortune; however, once the anyabhilasa, or 
improper desires change, we move to this level. 
</span><br>
<span className="">The Life of All Transcendental Knowledge
</span><br>
<span className="">All of the topics of discussion from this first verse 
focus  on  congregational  chanting,  which  results  in 
these seven types of perfection. The fourth perfec-
tion  is  vidya-vadhu-jivanam  or  the  life  of  all  tran-
scendental  knowledge.  “The  Mundaka  Upanisad 
mentions  two  types  of  knowledge:  material  and 
transcendental.”  Laukika  vidya  is  material  knowl-
edge and para vidya is transcendental knowledge. 
Material  knowledge  gives  information  about  the 
separated energies of the Lord:
</span><br>
<span className="">bhumir apo ‘nalo vayuh
kham mano buddhir eva ca
ahankara itiyam me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
</span><br>
<span className="">“Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, 
intelligence and false ego–all together 
these  eight  constitute  My  separated 
material energies.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">Bhagavad-gita 7.4
</span><br>
<span className="">The chanting gives us the life of all transcendental 
knowledge and the holy name contains all aspects

</span><br>

</span><br>
<span className="">of transcendence, far surpassing all material knowl-
edge.
</span><br>
<span className="">Increasing the Ocean of Transcendental Bliss
</span><br>
<span className="">The fifth perfection, anandambudhi-vardhanam, 
increases  the  ocean  of  transcendental  bliss.  Lord 
Caitanya  does  not  refer  to  a  puddle  or  a  river,  but 
specifically describes the chanting as a tremendous 
ocean of transcendental bliss for the living beings. 
“Only  a  vast  expanse  of  water  is  called  an  ocean, 
nothing  less;  therefore  unlimited  bliss  has  been 
rightly compared to an ocean.”
</span><br>
<span className="">Tasting Nectar at Every Step
</span><br>
<span className="">Number six, prati-padam purnamrtasvadanam, 
means  that  the  chanting  enables  us  to  taste  the 
nectar  at  every  step.  We  can  taste  the  nectar  that 
always awaits us. The living entity perpetually feels 
anticipation, knowing that somewhere there is some-
thing greater and even more wonderful. Although we 
have so many experiences, we often feel something 
is missing and hope for something sweeter. Just as a 
fish out of water cannot feel proper until it returns to 
its natural situation, a conditioned soul will not feel 
fully  satisfied  until  it  can  also  return  to  its  natural 
position.  Nama-sankirtana  fulfills  this  purpose  by 
enabling us to taste the nectar, which is available at 
every step.

<span className="">Questions &amp; Answers
Question:  Lord  Caitanya  spoke  about  the  fire  of 
material  existence.  Could  you  elaborate  on  this 
topic? 
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  Yes,  it  is  simple.  Often,  the  senses  force 
one to act in direct opposition to the mind and intel-
ligence. They are constantly stimulated and agitated 
due  to  contact  with  sense  objects.  Lord  Caitanya 
along  with  Srila  Prabhupada,  Srila  Bhaktivinoda 
Thakura and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura 
all give this understanding and describe the senses 
as a blazing fire. We are in an emergency situation 
because a fire leads to devastation and destruction. 
The fire is intense and capable of burning everything 
in its path. The senses act in this way and have great 
power to agitate us.
</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  Can  this  relate  to  the  verse  which 
describes how one is impelled to act sinfully as if by 
force?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  Yes. That is the lust. Lust actually causes 
the  coverings  but  the  contaminations  such  as 
improper  desires,  fruitive  activities  and  even  artifi-
cial renunciation are all a part of lust. Love is proper 
and lust is the opposite of love, so Lord Caitanya has 
given  us  the  key  to  convert  lust  into  love—energy 
transference.

<span className="">Cleansing the Mirror of the Heart  
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: The vibration of the mantra is really an 
internal  connection  because  if  we  watch  someone 
hearing the mantra for the first time, they may like 
the  beat  or  find  themselves  dancing  and  singing 
without even understanding the significance.
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  This  response  may  happen  if  they  are 
pious.  Some  people  hear  the  mantra  and  want  to 
run  away  or  even  want  to  push  the  person  down. 
Some  people  get  so  disturbed  from  this  chanting; 
however,  other  people  might  hear  the  mantra  and 
feel very inspired. Certain people hear the chanting 
and will continue singing the mantra throughout the 
entire day.
</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  Are  you  saying  that  the  chanting  can 
actually invoke some demoniac energy? 
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: Yes. A very sinful person who comes into 
contact  with  anything  related  to  transcendence 
will  become  angry,  disturbed  or  bothered.  On  the 
other hand, a pious individual who sees a beautiful 
picture of Krsna will feel a sense of well-being and 
feel captivated or curious. Another individual might 
hear the holy name, see a picture of Krsna or hear 
of His qualities and pastimes, but become angry or 
even violent. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: Could this negative reaction be a type of 
purging of the demoniac energy inside them? If they 
could just stay with it, would they get purified?

</span><br>
<span className="">Reflections On Sacred Teachings, Volume One
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  Yes.  If  they  stay,  they  will  definitely  get 
purified. We can compare the situation to a thief. If 
a thief is trying to rob the bank, the last person they 
want to see is the policeman. This would completely 
interfere  with  their  entire  program.  Someone  who 
wants to be God certainly wants to deny any knowl-
edge in connection with the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. The demonic want their own senses and 
desires to be supreme and want to have the power 
of the Godhead. Therefore, anything godly becomes 
threatening  and  disturbing,  causing  an  inimical 
reaction. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: This is a point that causes me trouble. On 
the one hand, I believe in my heart that at the core of 
our beings we are all eternal spirit souls, servants of 
Krsna, and loving entities. On the other hand, a part 
of me believes that some people walking around are 
just not right. I have a really hard time integrating or 
holding that belief, because I want to be able to see 
even the murderer as a pure soul who is really lost. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: That is a nice question and you have actu-
ally  already  explained  the  answer  yourself  in  the 
question. Ultimately, everyone is a part of God and 
the  soul  is  pure  but  the  problems  arise  due  to  the 
coverings.  The  main  problem  is  penetrating  the 
coverings.
</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  Are  there  actually  demons  and  Vais-
navas?  Are  there  souls  that  are  just  evil?  Is  that 
possible?

</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: There are demons, demoniac energy and 
demoniac  influence.  There  are  also  saintly  souls, 
saintly  personalities  and  blessings  from  such 
personalities. Everything is personal, but there is 
the  saktiman  and  the  sakti  or  energy.  Krsna  is 
personal; however, He also has His different ener-
gies  such  as  bahiranga,  tatastha,  antaranga, 
etc.  So,  there  are  actual  demons,  and  there  are 
the  negative  energies  or  influences  from  those 
demons. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: Can demons become devotees? 
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  No  one  is  ever  too  deep  in  maya  that 
they  cannot  be  helped.  Even  the  greatest  demon 
cannot defeat Krsna’s love. No maya can be greater 
than  Krsna.  Even  the  most  sinful  and  degraded 
individual can always be helped. However, at our 
state of awareness, we have to be able to perceive 
danger in certain associations. Although we want 
to be caring and loving, we can feel disturbed with 
people  for  their  sinful  actions  or  for  actions  that 
they perpetuate in others. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  Since  harinama-sankirtana  is  so 
important, why do our temples not engage in this 
process  as  much  anymore?  When  I  first  joined, 
some devotees would actually go out every single 
day for sankirtana but now the devotees do not go 
out as much.

<span className="">Reflections On Sacred Teachings, Volume One
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  Everything  is  connected  to  the  idea  of 
chanting  the  Lord’s  name.  Many  devotees  do  not 
even chant japa. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Other  devotees  have  a  fear  about  engaging  in 
bhajana  or  kirtana  together.  As  an  introverted 
person, I experienced this myself but I act differently 
in  the  interest  of  service.  However,  until  I  became 
a  sannyasi,  I  never  danced  in  any  kirtana.  It  was 
not  in  my  nature  to  be  so  outgoing.  Then  I  began 
to  realize  that  the  chanting  and  dancing  is  not  an 
ordinary affair; rather, this activity is an offering to 
the Lord as well as a connection with souls. Even as 
a materialist, I just never danced. As a spiritualist, I 
thought, “What is this, all this moving and dancing 
around?  What  do  they  think,  that  spiritual  life  is 
some kind of wild disco? They’re blowing my cool! I 
just want to be meditative.” It just seemed too overt 
and  unrelated  to  spiritual  life  but  actually,  every 
day  I  would  see  the  pictures  of  Lord  Caitanya  with 
His  hands  raised,  dancing  and  singing  with  drums 
and  karatalas.  Even  this  first  sloka  talks  about 
dancing. However, Prabhupada would get disturbed 
if we danced too wildly, not due to ecstasy but due 
to  improper  consciousness.  We  have  to  be  careful 
because sometimes the dancing gets a little “funky.” 
Devotees  can  even  have  accidents.  Several  years 
ago in Mayapur, some devotees were wildly throwing 
each  other  in  the  air  during  kirtana  and  actually 
hurt themselves.
</span><br>
<span className="">We  should  understand  that  the  yajna  for  this 
age includes congregational chanting in front of the

</span><br>
<span className="">Cleansing the Mirror of the Heart  
</span><br>
<span className="">Deities, japa, bhajanas and harinama-sankirtana. 
By diving deeper into the idea of calling on Krsna’s 
name,  we  can  make  this  aspect  of  the  spiritual 
world  more  of  a  reality  for  us.  In  these  pictures  of 
Lord  Caitanya,  we  always  see  drums,  karatalas, 
singing and dancing. Basically, the spiritual world is 
an  eternal  party  and  one  never  tires  of  the  eternal 
dance. Although we have different natures and incli-
nations, the idea is that we should always chant the 
holy name in all the possible ways. 
</span><br>
<span className="">When  we  begin  to  minimize  the  most  essential 
aspects  of  devotional  life,  we  will  start  to  substi-
tute  them  with  other  forms  of  sense  gratification 
and become again attracted to sensual stimulation. 
Srila Prabhupada has passed these specific formulas 
down  through  the  Vaisnava  line  for  a  very  special 
reason—the  process  works.  When  we  minimize 
the  process,  we  will  gradually  minimize  different 
aspects  of  devotional  life  and  soon  lose  the  taste 
for chanting. We will lose the taste to see the Deities 
or to engage in any congregational activity. It is deli-
cate. Minimizing certain activities makes it difficult 
to  perform  them  on  a  regular  basis.  For  instance, 
every day we shower as a natural habit, but if we get 
into the habit of showering one day a week, after a 
while it would become hard to return to our original 
standard of cleanliness. Once we fall into a pattern, 
it  becomes  more  difficult  to  escape.  Somebody 
may stop smoking but gradually begin again once a 
week and then twice a week. Once we make certain 
limits and follow them, they become regular parts of 
our lives. Of course this is hard due to the material

<span className="">body. It is hard to rise early in the morning and do 
anything.  We  might  prefer  to  sleep  until  9  o’clock 
or even sleep for 12 hours. There are only 24 hours 
in  a  day,  which  means  that  some  individuals  sleep 
half of their lives away. It is an austerity to wake up 
early, take a shower, chant japa and come to class. 
However,  when  we  fall  away  from  the  routine,  the 
program  will  become  even  harder  to  follow.  Some 
devotees  rarely  come  to  the  temple,  only  once  or 
twice  a  week,  and  during  the  entire  year  they  may 
only go into the temple room once or twice. Although 
they  may  appreciate  the  social  association  of  the 
devotees, they lose the mood of really honoring the 
Deities and honoring the chanting of the holy name. 
They may come to a program and honor prasadam 
but fail to see the Deities. Soon, everything loses its 
importance and just the thought of involving them-
selves more seems almost repulsive. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Maya  plays  many  games.  If  we  really  want  to 
learn, we can even learn from a new bhakta giving 
class.  At  the  very  least,  the  bhakta  will  read  the 
verse  and  explain  certain  points  from  some  level 
of  sincerity.  If  we  want  to  learn,  we  can  learn.  If 
we cannot hear from anyone except our  guru or a 
sannyasi, it means that our hearing is very mediocre 
despite our own high opinion of ourselves. We are to 
be the servant of the servant. The next verses of the 
Siksastaka will explain that we should not want any 
number of followers or aspire after profit, distinction 
or adoration. We should be able to learn from even 
the  ant.  We  have  many  different  types  of  gurus  to 
learn  from  in  our  environment.  We  can  even  learn

</span><br>
<span className="">from  a  sinful  person  by  examining  their  nonsense 
and  the  terrible  effects.  If  we  are  really  sincere  to 
learn, everything in the environment  can  teach  us. 
When we miss the deep culture, we will only be able 
to hear or learn from certain situations or environ-
ments. This is unfortunate. 
</span><br>
<span className="">We  need  to  watch  these  kinds  of  patterns  and 
try  to  appreciate  the  simplicity,  purity  and  profun-
dity of Krsna consciousness. These patterns can be 
very  dangerous.  We  have  all  experienced  different 
periods  of  ease  and  periods  of  difficulty,  but  once 
we begin to minimize the essential activities, maya 
will  really  attack.  In  boxing,  one  boxer  may  notice 
the  other  fighter  weakening.  At  this  point,  he  tries 
to  deliver  even  more  blows,  because  he  sees  that 
the opponent is weak. As soon as maya sees some 
weakness, she will immediately come in and finish 
us  off.  Maya  sees  a  devotee  not  chanting  their 
rounds,  and  this  provides  her  with  an  opportune 
moment  to  bring  in  so  many  material  desires  and 
finish the devotee.
</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  But  why?  Krsna  made  maya  so  why 
would He do that?
</span><br>
<span className=""> Answer: Maya is actually Krsna’s great friend, great 
supporter and great servant. Krsna brings you in by 
calling you and maya has her own way to bring you 
in.  Maya  tries  to  beat  you  to  ultimately  push  you 
towards Krsna and Krsna tries to call us. We can be 
stubborn and let maya beat us, or come to Krsna’s 
calling. It is all Krsna’s love.

<span className="">“O my Lord, Your holy name alone 
can  render  all  benediction  to  living 
beings,  and  thus  You  have  hundreds 
and  millions  of  names,  like  Krsna 
and Govinda. In these transcendental 
names  You  have  invested  all  Your 
transcendental  energies.  There  are 
not  even  hard  and  fast  rules  for

<span className="">one’s misfortune. This verse emphasizes the power 
of  the  holy  name  while  simultaneously  recognizing 
the  misfortune  of  the  living  entities  that  lack  the 
ability to use, appreciate or fully experience its true 
nature. This is the position of an aspiring devotee—
they  can  see  the  activities  in  the  environment,  but 
due to some limitations, cannot fully engage them-
selves. This is similar to a person with a handicap—
maybe they cannot walk or talk, or they may suffer 
from some serious complexities in their physical and 
mental states. The activities exist in a normal sense 
but the disabled individual cannot fully participate. 
Our experience as aspiring devotees relates to this 
example.  We  chant  but  we  cannot  fully  experience 
the holy name even though everything is present. It’s 
like being at a feast with your favorite preparations 
but you feel sick or nauseous. Although the food is 
available, you have no appetite. This situation is very 
sad because the fortune is accessible but we cannot 
fully experience it.
</span><br>
<span className="">Although  Krsna  gives  us  everything  through  the 
holy  name,  even  this  may  seem  too  much  of  an 
imposition. After executing the process in a mechan-
ical way without faith and without experiencing any 
nectar,  we  may  lose  our  conviction  and  even  our 
interest in pursuing the goal. For instance, a doctor 
may prescribe a certain medication, but if we do not 
follow the prescription properly, we will not receive 
the  results  and  will  quickly  lose  interest  in  the 
medicine. Sometimes this is the case. We may have 
chanted for a period of time and think, “I have been

</span><br>
<span className="">chanting for so many years and I still have material 
desires and bad habits. What is the point of all this 
chanting?” Our treasure is available but something 
prevents us from receiving it. This is durdaivam. 
</span><br>
<span className="">We are All Crazy
</span><br>
<span className="">Let us look at another example. Imagine you visit 
an  old  friend  at  his  house  and  find  him  running 
around on all fours like a dog. You try to talk to him 
and snap him out of this strange state, but he just 
barks at you and grabs the leg of your pants. You ask, 
“What  are  you  doing?  What  has  happened  to  you? 
I’m your friend!” but he simply remains absorbed in 
his own situation. Even though he has the capacity 
to  change  his  consciousness  and  communicate, 
due  to  a  mental  breakdown,  stress  or  drugs,  he  is 
completely  disturbed  and  stuck  in  the  conscious-
ness  of  a  dog.  The  higher  entities  or  those  of  a 
higher  consciousness  see  our  situation  in  this  way 
and understand our misfortune. Although the great 
fortune  is  before  us,  we  have  allowed  an  unneces-
sary  barrier  to  exist,  and  convinced  ourselves  that 
we  cannot  penetrate  it.  The  living  entity  under  the 
different modes of material nature is in this predica-
ment.  Even  the  residents  of  the  higher  planetary 
systems,  who  are  still  incarcerated  themselves  by 
certain  aspects  of  the  modes,  look  at  the  lower 
realms  and  see  the  activities  as  ridiculous,  absurd 
and  even  bestial.  What  makes  the  living  entity  so 
unfortunate?  The  misfortune  basically  results  from 
aparadhas or offenses.

<span className="">Our Unfortunate Position
</span><br>
<span className="">Just  imagine  an  unclean,  drunk  person  who 
enters  the  temple  with  shoes  on  and  creates  all 
types  of  disturbances.  The  person  is  loud,  obnox-
ious  and  boisterous.  The  temple  is  a  holy  place 
and  the  mercy  is  available  through  the  darsana  of 
the Deities, the classes on Srimad-Bhagavatam or 
Bhagavad-gita, the association of the devotees, and 
through prasadam. However, in their present state, 
they cannot experience or access the mercy because 
their  obnoxious  behavior  will  force  us  to  carefully 
escort  the  individual  out  the  door.  Although  the 
disturbance  is  a  problem,  their  offensive  behavior 
in such an environment is an even greater problem 
because  they  will  harm  themselves  on  a  deeper 
level. They will commit offenses and later suffer the 
consequences. We may give them prasadam, but we 
cannot  let  them  remain  in  the  spiritual  sanctuary. 
This person is quite unfortunate because they have 
a chance for fortune but cannot catch it.
</span><br>
<span className="">The Power of Chanting
</span><br>
<span className="">The second sloka expresses this mood of lamen-
tation.  Although  we  have  so  many  opportunities  to 
advance, we simply act rudely, faithlessly and offen-
sively.  The  following  sastric  quotes  relate  to  the 
potency  of  chanting  and  the  availability  of  fortune 
that one cannot fully access.

<span className="">Offenses Block Our Way
</span><br>
<span className="">There  are  many  similar  references  that  empha-
size what is possible and what is accessible but that 
our offenses, primarily nama-aparadhas, block our 
ability to receive. We do not need to wonder whether 
we make offenses since we constantly do; rather, it 
is a matter of the quantity of our aparadhas. There-
fore, much of the process of atma-vidya examines 
the superfluous and unnecessary things in our lives 
and provides the means to rid us of them. We may 
think that we do not make offenses and instead look 
at the offenses of others, or we may think that the 
medicine  does  not  work,  but  by  this,  we  will  miss 
the  chance  to  take  the  medicine  properly.  When 
we understand that we commit many offenses that 
are  simply  being  tolerated,  we  may  appreciate  the 
position of the drunken man who enters the temple 
room full of offenses. Although he can benefit from 
the  environment,  offenses  contaminate  practically 
all  of  his  actions.  The  greatest  misfortune  for  the 
drunkard  is  that  he  has  come  so  close  and  could 
have  benefited  from  this  liberating  situation,  but 
instead  he  only  harms  himself  due  to  his  incarcer-
ated  and  narcotized  state.  In  our  own  situations, 
we  make  offenses  that  interfere  or  slow  down  our 
chance to receive the boons. However, as long as we 
do  not  become  completely  ridiculous,  we  will  still 
make gradual progress. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Types of Offenses
</span><br>
<span className="">There are different types of aparadhas. Dhama-

<span className="">Our Unfortunate Position
</span><br>
<span className="">aparadhas or offenses committed in the holy places 
of  pilgrimage  are  very  serious  and  detrimental  to 
the  devotional  creeper.  The  temple  is  considered  a 
dhama or a place meant for spiritual worship, medi-
tation  and  reflection.  Such  places  carry  very  high 
potency  and,  because  these  places  can  offer  such 
high blessings, if one does not behave properly, one 
can bring forth many complexities. Seva-aparadha 
is  an  offense  made  during  the  different  kinds  of 
services. You might perform a service but you come 
late  and  in  an  unclean  state.  Maybe  you  cook  or 
engage  in  Deity  service  but  in  an  offensive  mood. 
Then  there  are  offenses  made  against  the  devo-
tees  or  vaisnava-aparadha  and  offenses  against 
the  spiritual  master  or  guru-aparadha.  Interest-
ingly,  when  one  continues  committing  a  particular 
offense,  it  will  inevitably  lead  to  other  offenses. 
Instead  of  remaining  stagnant  at  a  particular  level, 
it  develops  like  a  cancerous  growth  into  other 
offenses.  For  example,  if  someone  continuously 
commits  vaisnava-aparadha  without  compunction 
or  restraint,  the  offense  will  inevitably  grade  into 
guru-aparadha,  which  will  lead  to  doubting,  ques-
tioning  and  even  blaspheming  Krsna  Himself.  One 
aparadha leads to another. Similarly, if one chants 
offensively  with  no  regret  or  even  stops  chanting 
entirely,  different  complexities  and  sinful  thoughts 
will inevitably begin to settle in the consciousness. 
Someone may feel capable of maintaining the same 
level without the chanting, but this only lasts tempo-
rarily  due  to  previous  experiences  of  chanting  and

<span className="">previous sadhana. For example, you may be unem-
ployed now, but you can continue to eat due to your 
previous  savings.  Maybe  you  have  some  assets—a 
house  or  a  bank  account;  however,  if  you  do  not 
replenish  the  savings  account  or  assets,  after  a 
while, the money will gradually diminish. Later, the 
house will even begin to deteriorate with no money 
left for its maintenance. The way in which one activity 
supports another is very scientific. A strong activity 
in  one  area  will  bring  out  a  strong  connection  in 
another.  Conversely,  a  weakness  will  bring  out  the 
weakness in another area until a person becomes so 
unfortunate that they lose the ability to associate in 
spiritual environments. Our misfortune stems from 
nama-aparadha.

<span className="">The Holy Name Frees Us From Our Offenses
</span><br>
<span className="">Srila  Bhaktivinoda  Thakura  states  in  his  Sri 
</span><br>
<span className="">Bhajana-rahasya:
</span><br>
<span className="">“All 
</span><br>
<span className="">the  auspicious  potencies—
whether pious deeds, acts of charity, 
strict  vows,  penances,  going  on 
pilgrimage,  asvamedha  and  rajasuya 
sacrifices,  or  knowledge  of 
the 
Absolute—which  nullify  the  effects 
of  sinful  life,  have  been  assembled 
together  by  the  Supreme  Lord  and 
channeled 
into  His  holy  name, 
making it truly omnipotent.”

<span className="">Our Unfortunate Position
</span><br>
<span className="">Lord  Caitanya  explains  that  Krsna  feels  some 
sadness  or  disturbance  when  He  sees  the  living 
entity’s  intense  degree  of  suffering.  Consequently, 
He arranges to connect the living entity with His holy 
name. Even though one is unqualified and unlucky, 
especially  in  Kali-yuga,  Krsna  arranges  to  give 
something  very  powerful.  Unfortunately,  the  living 
entity  is  similar  to  a  drunkard  in  the  temple  and 
cannot properly receive. Bhaktivinoda Thakura also 
states in his Gitavali:
</span><br>
<span className="">  “Like  Your  transcendental  form, 
the holy name is  sac-cid-ananda and 
it  is  superior  even  to  touchstone 
(cintamani). You have distributed that 
touchstone-like hari-nama throughout 
the entire world. This is the topmost 
display  of  Your  mercy.  On  the  one 
hand,  Your  mercy 
is  extremely 
generous  and  beyond  compare,  yet 
on  the  other  hand,  my  misfortune 
is  very  great,  for  I  have  not  even 
the  slightest  attraction  towards  the 
magnanimous  name  of  Sri  Krsna. 
Therefore,  Bhaktivinoda 
Thakura 
says, ‘My heart is overwhelmed with 
sadness,  what  shall  I  do?  O  Lord! 
Now I am simply waiting expectantly 
upon Your causeless mercy.’”
</span><br>
<span className="">He  recognizes  that  Krsna  mercifully  and  freely

<span className="">distributes His holy name, but feels that he has little 
attraction for the name. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Ten Offenses Against the Holy Name
</span><br>
<span className="">There are ten offenses against the chanting of the 
holy  name  that  prevent  us  from  fully  experiencing 
what  is  available.  These  ten  offenses  lead  to  the 
craziness that interferes and minimizes the potency 
of our chanting. After mangala-arati every morning, 
before  we  chant  our  rounds,  we  recite  these  ten 
offenses  to  remind  ourselves  that  these  offenses 
keep us crazy, and if we can rid ourselves of these 
aparadhas,  we  will  no  longer  be  unfortunate  or 
unlucky.  We  will  be  able  to  experience  this  great 
fortune.  As  we  examine  the  ten  offenses,  we  can 
remind  ourselves  that  the  first  words  and  the  last 
words  are  most  important.  As  a  reminder,  the  first 
prayer of the Sri Siksastaka emphasizes the impor-
tance  of  congregational  chanting  and  the  very  last 
verse of the Bhagavatam ends with the importance 
of harinama-sankirtana. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Blaspheming Devotees
</span><br>
<span className="">The  first  offense  is  to  blaspheme  the  devotees 
who  have  dedicated  their  lives  to  the  propagation 
of  the  holy  names  of  the  Lord.  Obviously,  this  is 
very  serious.  When  one  gives  oneself  to  the  Lord, 
the Lord gives Himself in return. Krsna says that the 
pure  devotee  is  His  heart;  therefore,  to  offend  the 
devotee is to offend the Lord in the heart. We under-
stand  that  much  of  devotional  service  is  based  on

</span><br>
<span className="">12/26/02, 3:20 PM
</span><br>
<span className="">Our Unfortunate Position
</span><br>
<span className="">mercy, and mercy comes from the carriers of mercy. 
Therefore, what hope is there for one who commits 
such  offenses?  Krsna  does  not  give  this  high  level 
of bhakti so freely, because it allows us to purchase 
Him fully. He gives it through His agents who are very 
dear to Him. When they make a plea or request on 
our behalf, then Krsna accommodates. If we offend 
His  agents,  how  will  we  receive  the  mercy  connec-
tion? Of course, the offense is proportionate to the 
level of purity of the offended devotee. If one offends 
an advanced devotee who is very dear to Krsna, the 
offense is much more serious.
</span><br>
<span className="">Considering Demigods Equal to the Lord
</span><br>
<span className="">Offense number two is to consider the names of 
the demigods like Lord Siva and Lord Brahma to be 
equal  to  or  independent  of  the  holy  name  of  Lord 
Visnu. Why is this so important? Is Krsna just on an 
ego trip and ready to send hellfire and brimstone to 
anyone who considers another entity to be indepen-
dent of Him? No. Since His position is so special as 
Krsna,  the  adi-purusa,  the  Supreme  Personality  of 
Godhead, thinking of the demigods in this way will 
simply  cause  distraction.  The  demigods  are  great 
personalities, but they are not supreme and are not 
ultimately  responsible  for  the  totality  of  creation. 
In  one  sense,  demigod  worship  is  comparable  to 
bribery,  where  one  tries  to  subvert  the  legitimate 
connection.  In  this  case,  one  may  not  be  ready  to 
fully honor the ultimate connection but still wants to 
receive the highest results from the lesser connec-

</span><br>
<span className="">tion. This cheating mentality will not provide freedom 
from our insanities. So, the drunken man comes into 
the temple and this time he removes his shoes, but 
he still has so many other problems. Consequently, 
he still cannot catch up with the mercy and fortune 
that is available.
</span><br>
<span className="">Disobeying the Spiritual Master
</span><br>
<span className="">Offense number three is to disobey the orders of 
the  spiritual  master.  Why  is  this  an  offense?  After 
all,  we  are  not  offending  Krsna,  or  are  we?  Krsna 
arranges  this  situation  to  let  us  practice.  Just  as 
a  sportsman  or  musician  needs  to  prepare  for  an 
event,  we  also  need  to  prepare  and  practice.  The 
spiritual  master  acts  as  the  ambassador  or  the 
postman, and also acts as an element for our prac-
tice as we endeavor to cultivate more devotion and 
love  for  Krsna.  In  our  contaminated  state,  we  can 
no longer make that connection with Krsna, so the 
spiritual master trains us to become civil, to become 
human and to become spiritual. In his contaminated 
state, the drunkard is not ready to enter the temple, 
but  if  someone  helps  him  and  teaches  him  the 
proper behavior, one day he can come to the temple 
and  remain  in  the  environment.  Just  imagine  this 
same  analogy  in  relation  to  the  conditioned  soul. 
If we one day return to the spiritual world with our 
current mentality, perceptions, enviousness, lust and 
greed, we would simply create a disturbance. Since 
no imperfections can enter into the spiritual world, 
we have no right or ability to go to such a place. Just

<span className="">examine the mind from day-to-day and consider the 
type of reflections that fill our minds and constantly 
bother  us.  From  this  analysis,  we  will  discover  our 
similarity to the drunkard who has so much fortune 
available but cannot experience it due to his absur-
dity  and  obnoxiousness.  For  this  reason,  we  read 
about  the  possibilities  and  about  these  different 
types of offenses that prevent us from experiencing 
this great fortune. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Blaspheming Vedic Literature
</span><br>
<span className="">Offense  number  four  is  to  blaspheme  the  Vedic 
literatures  or  literatures  in  pursuance  of  the  Vedic 
version.  The  scriptures  are  literary  incarnations  of 
God,  Krsna,  and  are  even  worshipable.  One  can 
offer obeisances to these scriptures and even offer 
some puja as in Deity worship. For this reason, we 
do not read them with dirty hands or put them on the 
floor  because  they  are  spiritual.  Krsna’s  words  and 
Krsna’s pastimes with the devotees are non-different 
from Krsna Himself. To blaspheme the Vedic litera-
ture is very destructive, because it is an assault on 
the Lord and His mercy. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Considering the Glories of Chanting to be 
Imagination
</span><br>
<span className="">The  fifth  offense  is  to  consider  the  glories  of 
chanting  the  holy  name  to  be  imagination.  In  this 
case, one basically considers that the glories of the 
holy  name  are  a  lie,  simply  theoretical  or  not  an 
actual reality. It corresponds with the sixth offense,

</span><br>
<span className="">62
</span><br>
<span className="">12/26/02, 3:20 PM
</span><br>
<span className="">63
</span><br>
<span className="">Reflections On Sacred Teachings, Volume One
</span><br>
<span className="">which  is  to  give  some  mundane  interpretation  on 
the holy name of the Lord. Once one views the holy 
name as imaginary or unreal, one begins to create 
personal ideas, perceptions and speculations. These 
perverted  conceptions  contaminate  it  in  the  same 
way  that  a  serpent  contaminates  milk  through  the 
touch  of  its  mouth.  Consequently,  one’s  so-called 
knowledge becomes useless.
</span><br>
<span className="">Committing Sinful Activities
</span><br>
<span className="">The  seventh  offense  is  to  commit  sinful  activi-
ties on the strength of chanting the holy name. For 
example, maybe the drunkard enters the temple with 
his  obnoxious  behavior  and  causes  a  disturbance, 
but  this  time  he  immediately  apologizes.  However, 
thirty  seconds  later  he  makes  the  same  mistake, 
but again apologizes. Maybe he knocks over tulasi, 
tries to walk on the altar, touches Srila Prabhupada 
or tries to bother the women. He continues to apolo-
gize, but does not change his behavior.  Finally,  we 
have to apologize and ask him to leave. His apologies 
become ridiculous, because he is not sorry enough 
to  change  his  behavior.  He  tries  one  behavior  and 
when  the  devotees  check  him,  he  simply  looks  for 
some other obnoxious activity. He is exploiting the 
kindness  of  the  devotees.  The  devotees  give  him 
some prasadam and he goes away but soon returns 
with the same nonsense behavior. It is very offensive 
to  the  atmosphere  and  even  exploitative.  It  is  very 
bad to play these games with the Lord, His environ-
ment, the devotees and the holy name. It is similar

</span><br>
<span className="">12/26/02, 3:20 PM
</span><br>
<span className="">Our Unfortunate Position
</span><br>
<span className="">to  a  person  who  commits  a  sin  and  thinks,  “I  can 
just  chant  some  extra  rounds  and  sin  again  and 
again.”  The  holy  name  is  very  powerful  and  gives 
great fortune, but this is a very unfortunate way to 
use it.
</span><br>
<span className="">Considering Chanting to be Karma-Kanda
</span><br>
<span className="">The  eighth  offense  is  to  consider  the  chanting 
of  Hare  Krsna  as  one  of  the  auspicious,  ritualistic 
activities offered in the Vedas as fruitive activities or 
karma-kanda. It is an offense to equate the chanting 
of the holy name to routine religion, penance, renun-
ciation,  sacrifice  or  any  activity  meant  for  mate-
rial  benefit.  The  chanting  of  the  holy  name  is  not 
oriented towards the heavenly kingdom or material 
piety. It is far beyond these material results. These 
thoughts are contaminated. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Preaching to the Faithless
</span><br>
<span className="">The ninth offense is to preach the glories of the 
holy  name  to  the  faithless  person.  What  does  this 
mean to instruct a faithless person? It seems to be 
a contradiction because Lord Caitanya instructs us 
to preach the glories of the holy name in every town 
and  village.  Lord  Caitanya  gave  knowledge,  mercy 
and blessings to everyone, qualified or unqualified, 
so that everyone could have a chance to make some 
spiritual  advancement.  However,  this  ninth  offense 
states  that  one  should  not  instruct  the  faithless. 
This  means  that  we  give  everyone  a  chance  or  an 
opportunity  to  receive,  but  if  someone  becomes

</span><br>
<span className="">angry, offensive or violent, we should not try to give 
them more, because they will simply become more 
offensive. As we said earlier, they will have to suffer 
for their offenses. It is better to avoid preaching to 
such an offensive person, because they will simply 
become  more  entangled  in  their  karmic  reactions. 
For instance, you may try to help an alcoholic out of 
compassion,  but  as  soon  as  you  start  talking  with 
them,  they  become  violent  and  begin  cursing.  At 
that  point  communication  is  impossible.  If  you  try 
to  continue  the  conversation,  you  will  cause  them 
to  act  more  absurdly  which  will  not  be  healthy  for 
them. It is the duty of a devotee to always try to help 
raise the consciousness. If we cannot help, we surely 
do  not  want  to  bring  harm.  Therefore,  one  should 
carefully avoid such an offense. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Not Having Complete Faith
</span><br>
<span className="">The tenth offense is to not have complete faith in 
the chanting of the holy name and to maintain mate-
rial attachments even after understanding so many 
instructions on this matter. It is also an offense to be 
inattentive while chanting. It is an offense to not have 
complete faith in the holy name even after hearing 
so many, many instructions on this subject matter. 
This offense completely shows one’s lack of qualifi-
cation, because although one receives so much help 
and information, one stubbornly continues to reject 
and to minimize the potency. These are the blocks 
that cause our misfortune.

</span><br>
<span className="">Our Unfortunate Position
</span><br>
<span className="">Understanding the Name
</span><br>
<span className="">Krsna  has  invested  all  of  His  potencies  into  His 
holy name, as stated in the second sloka: “In these 
transcendental names You have invested all of Your 
transcendental  energies.”  In  order  to  gain  more 
clarity, let us define nama or the holy name. There 
are  different  categories  of  nama.  Mukhya  are  the 
primary names and gauna are the secondary names. 
The primary names are also further separated into 
two  categories,  the  madhurya  related  names  and 
the aisvarya related names. The madhurya related 
names  represent  Krsna’s  sweet,  intimate,  loving 
features associated with His confidential exchanges 
and  pastimes  in  Vrndavana.  The  aisvarya  names 
refer to Krsna as the opulent, powerful and all-domi-
nating God. These names represent the Lord’s rever-
ential aspect and His opulence. Krsna has invested 
all of His transcendental energies into these primary 
names or mukhya. In contrast to these names, we 
have  the  secondary  names.  Several  examples  of 
mukhya  names  that  emphasize  Krsna’s  sweetness 
and intimate, loving affairs include Krsna, Govinda, 
Syamasundara, Damodara, Gopinatha and Kunjabi-
hari. In the primary madhurya and aisvarya names, 
Krsna invests all of His potencies. This means that all 
rasa, all knowledge, all experiences, all fortune and 
all potencies are available in these names if we free 
ourselves from aparadhas. Several names of Krsna 
that  represent  His  opulence  and  reverential  aspect 
include  Narayana,  Nrsimhadeva,  Visnu,  Rama, 
Vasudeva, Paramatma, Allah, God, Yahweh and the

</span><br>
<span className="">Creator. Although these are also personal names of 
God, they do not deal with the intimate madhurya 
aspect. All of the primary names carry Krsna’s full 
transcendental potencies, but the secondary names 
do not have this same potency. There will be some 
benefit  from  the  secondary  names  but  not  in  the 
same  way.  They  are  still  names  of  the  Lord  but 
deal with general categories of greatness instead of 
specific pastimes of greatness. 
</span><br>
<span className="">This second sloka also emphasizes that there are 
no hard and fast rules for chanting these holy names. 
You can chant in the morning, in the evening, in the 
shower,  in  the  park,  in  the  temple,  in  your  house 
or  your  car  with  the  same  full  potency.  However, 
the  chanting  should  obviously  be  done  attentively 
because  inattentive  chanting  is  also  offensive.  The 
potency is there but we must also observe our level 
of attentiveness. If we can chant more attentively in 
the mountains, such a situation might be better for 
us. If we chant more attentively on the corner, while 
walking,  while  sitting  in  the  lotus  position  or  while 
standing  up,  we  can  chant  accordingly  since  there 
are  no  hard  and  fast  rules.  Some  devotees  chant 
more attentively while standing or walking because 
they  might  otherwise  fall  asleep.  Other  devotees 
can  chant  better  while  looking  at  a  picture.  Some 
devotees chant better if they think of one of Krsna’s 
pastimes.  Some  devotees  chant  more  attentively 
while looking at a picture of their guru. There are no 
hard and fast rules. The idea is to dive deeper into 
the chanting.

</span><br>
<span className="">Questions &amp; Answers
Question: Lord Caitanya says: “I am so unfortunate 
that I have no attraction for the holy name.” I have 
never been able to truly understand this statement. 
How  does  seeing  ourselves  as  unfortunate  help  us 
to advance?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  We  must  look  at  our  material  situation 
with a certain amount of disgust in order to develop 
zeal  to  acquire  the  fortune  of  the  holy  name.  For 
example,  we  may  have  some  friends  who  we  went 
to school with in the past, and we notice that they 
have succeeded in very wonderful ways. We engaged 
in  similar  activities  and  could  have  had  the  same 
achievements,  but  we  lacked  the  necessary  enthu-
siasm to make the most of the same opportunities. 
Consequently, we feel unfortunate. We should take 
the humble position. We do not lament in a hopeless 
and gloomy mood that keeps us stagnant; rather, we 
lament in the spirit of anticipation and eagerness to 
improve.  Without  this  lamentation,  we  will  compla-
cently  accept  our  fate  and  comfortably  accept  our 
position.  The  lamentation  can  act  as  a  catalyst  to 
increase  our  eagerness  for  that  which  we  have  not 
yet acquired. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: I was reflecting on the differences between 
the  New  Age  movement  and  Krsna  consciousness, 
realizing that bhakti-yoga is much more grounded 
and brings God into the picture. The New Age move-
ment  talks  about  the  bliss  and  the  expansiveness,

</span><br>
<span className="">but it does not manifest here on earth. Bhakti-yoga 
brings  the  practice  to  a  practical  level.  It  involves 
service and work such as milking the cows and using 
the body, but simultaneously being filled with Krsna. 
I  believe  that  it  is  culturally  rich  and  very  different 
from these New Age practices. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  That  is  a  nice  realization.  Much  of  the 
New  Age  movement  deals  with  mukti  or  the  idea 
of liberation and the desire to get “blissed-out” on 
God’s  energies.  It  is  actually  a  movement  for  spiri-
tual  intoxication  rather  than  real  love  and  service 
to  God.  It  is  still  rather  self-centered  because  one 
normally wants to experience, have and enjoy, in a 
certain way, more than becoming a pure servant of 
the Godhead. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Even  in  basic  material  relationships,  real  love 
goes  beyond  enjoying  another  person  because 
they make you feel good; rather, the love manifests 
through  your  desire  to  spend  time  with  them  and 
serve them. Love is there and love spills over from 
you, but you also want to show the person that you 
care and love them. You feel good about doing self-
less  acts  as  an  expression  of  your  love.  When  the 
love  is  not  so  strong,  you  may  have  a  good  feeling 
about  the  other  person’s  association,  but  it  simply 
stems from the feelings and stimulation you receive 
from that person. You do not really think about your 
partner  or  enjoy  activities  simply  for  their  benefit. 
For some individuals, it may sound strange that we 
continuously talk about Krsna. We always talk about

</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  I  find  that  my  mind  always  thinks  the 
most  ridiculous  and  even  mean  thoughts  about 
other  devotees.  I  cannot  even  seem  to  control  it. 
What  is  a  good  way  to  check  these  thoughts  that 
seem beyond my control?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: Srila Bhaktisiddhanta said that one should 
take  a  shoe  and  beat  the  mind.  Not  literally,  but 
the idea is that the mind is so crazy and wild that it 
needs to be tamed in such a way. Nevertheless, we 
must not identify with the mind. If we see ourselves 
as defined by the mind, we will latch onto and iden-
tify  with  all  the  garbage  that  it  presents,  and  the 
senses  will  express  themselves  accordingly.  We 
should view our mind as a separate entity that has 
accompanied us for a long time. First  it  finds ways 
to trick us and then it laughs at us. It is just like a 
clown.  When  you  associate  with  a  clown,  he  may 
first  do  something  to  get  you  off  balance  and  then 
laugh at you, making you feel foolish. The mind also 
acts in this way. It sets up different situations, and 
after you fall prey to the tricks, it says, “Ah-ha, you 
fool! I got you again!” It entices you until you finally 
succumb to the trick. The danger is that as you give 
into  the  mind  it  becomes  stronger  and  stronger.  If 
maya  would  leave  you  alone  after  you  satisfy  her 
demands and pay your dues, it would be a different

<span className="">story. However, maya does not work in this way—it 
is the complete opposite. The more you give into the 
bad habits and give into the gross or subtle maya, 
the  more  you  become  habituated  and  addicted. 
Then  once  you  try  to  rid  yourself  of  the  addiction, 
maya says, “I know you! You normally give into me. 
What is the big deal now? Have you forgotten about 
this type of enjoyment?” Maya laughs at you. “You 
are trying to be strong but I know your weaknesses. I 
know what you really want to do, and I can wait until 
you are ready.” Maya sees the situation. It is like a 
drug dealer who approaches the addict. The addict 
says,  “No,  I  am  not  into  drugs  anymore.”  However, 
the  seller  wants  to  sell  and  once  again  involve  the 
addict. The seller may say, “I know the problem. This 
is not enough for you but let me show you this drug. 
I  will  even  give  it  to  you  at  half  price.”  So,  maya 
finds  a  way  to  entice  you  because  she  knows  your 
weaknesses.  She  tries  to  captivate  your  existence. 
For  this  reason,  it  is  dangerous.  If  you  give  into 
maya, you become more and more accustomed to 
the  stimulation,  which  makes  it  harder  and  harder 
to stop. After a while, we can end up in an almost 
helpless position. Sometimes the addictions absorb 
a person to such an extent that they hate themselves 
and constantly wish they were not in such a position. 
However,  they  are  so  stuck  that  the  struggle  to  get 
out is very difficult. When we habitually surrender to 
maya, it will seem almost impossible to get out of 
the  situation.  It  is  never  actually  impossible,  but  it 
will be very, very difficult.

<span className="">Our Unfortunate Position
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: How do we know that our entrapment by 
the mind is not actually a sinful reaction from a past 
life or just our karma?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  You  do  not  even  have  to  question  it.  It  is 
definitely  karma  from  the  past  and  karma  from 
the present. Karma is just the reaction of our past 
activities,  speech,  aspirations,  etc.  Our  karma  is 
constantly  unfolding  from  activities  in  the  past 
and  even  from  our  current  behavior.  We  are  either 
becoming  more  involved  or  less  involved  in  the 
karma factor. We are trying to become karma -free 
by  engaging  in  transcendental  activities  that  are 
under the protection of the parampara. Then we will 
undergo fewer reactions that can stagnate us.
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: How does a good reaction come? Since 
karma is not just negative reactions but also posi-
tive reactions, how does this work in balancing the 
negative karma? Is it already counterbalanced since 
we are not more fallen than our current status?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: This relates to the previous example of an 
unemployed  person  who  worked  and  saved  money 
but  currently  does  not  receive  an  income.  If  we 
perform  pious  activities,  we  receive  credits,  and  if 
we engage in negative activities, we lose the credits. 
We  have  a  certain  balance,  and  if  we  keep  with-
drawing without depositing, the credits will eventu-
ally diminish. As long as we remain in these material 
bodies, in material consciousness, we have to stay

<span className="">in  these  material  environments  and  associate  with 
the karma in that way. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  When  one  commits  an  offense,  the 
reaction  is  more  offenses.  If  one  engages  in  pious 
activities,  will  one  gain  more  pious  activities  as  a 
reaction?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  The  converse  is  also  true.  If  you  commit 
offenses,  the  reaction  is  like  cancer.  You  commit 
one offense, which leads into other offenses until it 
becomes  greater  and  greater.  If  you  perform  pious 
activities,  you  may  become  connected  with  more 
pious  activities  and  eventually  with  transcendental 
activities. Many people who have some association 
with  transcendental  knowledge  and  lifestyle  were 
very  pious  individuals.  Their  piety  accumulated  to 
such  an  extent  that  they  received  a  book  or  heard 
from the devotees, and this allowed them to eventu-
ally come to devotional service. In one sense, Krsna 
consciousness is for everyone since it is everyone’s 
natural birthright, but in another sense it is not quite 
that easy. We cannot go to the spiritual world unless 
the  agents  of  the  spiritual  world  invite  us  or  bless 
us to return. There are even powerful material orga-
nizations  or  secret  societies  that  require  a  special 
invitation from a current member. You cannot simply 
join, but if they feel you have something to offer or 
contribute  to  the  spirit  of  their  organization,  they 
might offer you an invitation. For this reason, Lord 
Caitanya came to make this connection accessible.

<span className="">He sends His great servants such as Rupa Gosvami, 
Jiva  Gosvami,  Madhavendra  Puri,  Bhaktivinoda 
Thakura,  Srila  Bhaktisiddhanta,  Srila  Prabhupada, 
etc.  because  they  are  residents  from  the  spiritual 
world  and  they  give  the  connection.  For  these 
reasons,  Krsna  consciousness  is  mind  boggling  to 
most  people  and  is  most  powerful  and  dangerous. 
Very  few  societies  in  the  world  emphasize  such  a 
level of commitment between the disciple and guru. 
It is not a system in which one creates, interpolates 
or  speculates;  rather,  it  is  a  system  in  which  the 
original reality is handed down and we must grab it. 
Krsna extends Himself by sending His agents; there-
fore,  we  need  to  fully  and  intensely  connect  with 
these  agents.  However,  it  is  dangerous  because  if 
we do not handle this powerful connection properly, 
we can create all kinds of offenses or get abused. It 
requires intense faith and dedication. In relation to 
karma, if we do get abused or exploited, there is a 
lesson for us to learn since Krsna has allowed such 
an experience to take place in our life at a certain 
time. It is not that God is unfair or that He will allow 
some type of accident to happen in your life. If there 
are accidents, then the atheistic scientists are right 
and there is no infallible God. In that case, we are 
just  involved  in  mythology  and  simply  pray  to  God 
in order to feel good or to make us psychologically 
strong  through  some  God  conception.  No,  this  is 
not  the  case.  Krsna  and  His  agents  are  giving  a 
powerful prescription that works if we take it prop-
erly.  However,  we  are  so  unfortunate  because  we

<span className="">have the medicine but are not ready to take it prop-
erly  and  have  now  lost  faith  in  the  process.  Srila 
Prabhupada explains in the Bhagavad-gita that we 
can become Krsna conscious in a second or it may 
take  many,  many  lifetimes.  It  is  simply  a  matter  of 
accepting the facts.
</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  In  our  religious  support  group  that  we 
have  on  Monday  nights,  we  investigate  the  ten 
offenses and expose which of the offenses gives us 
the most problems. Generally, most of the devotees 
have trouble with the first and last offenses the most. 
Are these two offenses the most important ones for 
us to try and avoid in order to progress on this path 
of bhakti?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  The  first  offense  will  automatically  cause 
the  others.  If  one  commits  the  first  offense,  the 
tenth  offense  will  automatically  follow.  It  is  just  a 
matter  of  its  level  of  intensity.  The  tenth  offense  is 
to maintain material attachments even after hearing 
so many instructions on the matter and to continue 
without fully accepting or appreciating. If you make 
the first offense, there is no way that you can appre-
ciate  the  last  one.  There  is  no  way  that  it  can  be 
strong for you. One may not speak  about it  openly 
but  the  other  offenses  will  also  be  there.  We  have 
to increasingly appreciate that spiritual life is about 
spiritual  community.  We  are  not  returning  to  the 
spiritual  world  to  “bliss-out”  in  mukti  or  nirvana 
while  having  our  own  ideas  and  experiences  of

<span className="">Krsna’s impersonal energies. Rather, we will engage 
in  services  in  the  spiritual  environment  that  focus 
on  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead.  However, 
it  is  not  that  one  just  waits  for  Krsna  to  appear 
while  considering  everything  else  to  be  useless 
and  everyone  else  to  be  valueless.  For  instance, 
sometimes  we  disregard  everyone  except  our  own 
guru or we have no concern for anyone except our 
favorite sannyasi. We have no time to hear anyone 
else’s classes and have no desire to serve any other 
devotees.  This  is  complete  nonsense  because  this 
mood has nothing to do with the atmosphere of the 
spiritual world, which is about intense appreciation. 
Every  single  position  is  appreciated  with  love  and 
devotion regardless of the particular rasa or service 
exchange.  We  are  practicing  to  return  to  the  spiri-
tual world and it begins and ends with the quality of 
our day-to-day association with sadhus. If we have 
strong  association  with  sadhus,  our  appreciation 
for  guru  and  Krsna  will  naturally  increase.  Just  as 
offenses  grade  from  one  to  another,  the  devotion 
grades from one level to another. One who does not 
have serious love, care and compassion for sadhus 
is  not  going  anywhere  in  terms  of  their  transcen-
dental connection. One can perform many sacrifices, 
learn  scriptures,  chant  Hare  Krsna  for  years,  give 
laksmi  or  honor  prasadam,  but  these  devotional 
activities will not matter if one does not include this 
most basic consideration. The person will continue 
developing,  but  much  of  their  devotional  creeper 
or service will be on hold. If the creeper is on hold

<span className="">for  too  long  without  any  growth,  something  has  to 
break. Either they will start back sliding because of a 
lack of realization or a lack of sufficient rejuvenation, 
or they will finally understand the proper way to take 
the prescription and make the necessary changes in 
order to receive the full benefit of the medicine. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: It is said that there are no hard and fast 
rules  for  chanting  the  holy  names.  However,  there 
are some recommendations for chanting the sixteen 
rounds of japa. For example, one should not chant 
while driving. Are there other exceptions or recom-
mendations? Could you explain this further? 
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  These are just practical considerations. If 
you  are  driving  and  chanting  very  powerfully,  you 
may lose concentration on the secular situation that 
requires  your  attention.  On  the  other  hand,  your 
chanting may simply become of such a poor quality. 
When it says that there are no hard and fast rules, it 
means that there is always benefit from the chanting, 
but some situations are more beneficial than others. 
It is not that we can only chant in the day or night, 
softly  or  loudly,  in  the  temple  or  the  house,  etc. 
There  are  no  hard  and  fast  rules  but  certain  situa-
tions facilitate quality chanting more than others. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  In  relation  to  devotee  relationships,  it 
seems that we sometimes get stuck in ways of being 
or relating with each other. Year after year we even 
find ourselves repeating the same patterns. Some of

<span className="">Our Unfortunate Position
</span><br>
<span className="">us are waking up to the fact that we have to change 
our relationships and ways of relating to each other. 
Could you make any comment on this? 
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  If  we  do  not  realize  the  gravity  of  our 
illness,  we  will  not  take  the  prescription  seriously 
enough and will not sufficiently treat the sickness or 
disease. We tend to minimize the influence of Kali-
yuga  and  Western  culture,  which  revolves  around 
competitiveness,  impersonalism  and  self-centered-
ness.  There  is  tremendous  superficiality  about  the 
God conception. As a result, when we enter the spiri-
tual environment, we think that we are all right and 
do not work deeply enough to break away from the 
many terrible patterns that we bring with us. Until we 
can see the seriousness of our disease, we will not 
endeavor sufficiently to make the necessary changes. 
We tend to think that because we have the greatest 
philosophy and all the other people are “just mate-
rialists” or karmis, we are OK. We may be admitted 
to the most wonderful hospital, but we are still sick 
and have to take the prescribed medicine and treat-
ment. If we have the most wonderful facilities but do 
not take advantage of them, we may as well check 
into a poor hospital or stay at home. We may go into 
a hospital and think, “This is a famous hospital with 
the  best  doctors.  I  have  heart  trouble  but  the  best 
heart  surgeons  are  here.  I  have  brain  damage  but 
the best brain surgeons are here. I am all right. I am 
in the hospital and these are my doctors.” However, 
if  we  do  not  take  the  treatment  or  the  medicine,

</span><br>
<span className="">our situation will not improve. If we have a serious 
problem such as cancer, heart disease, etc. and have 
the facility to receive the treatment from competent 
specialists  or  from  top  experts,  it  does  not  neces-
sarily mean that we are under this treatment and are 
taking it sufficiently. This also occurs in the universi-
ties.  Some  universities  are  very  famous  and  highly 
endowed,  but  at  the  undergraduate  level,  they  are 
not  so  good.  You  may  go  to  the  university  with  all 
of  these  famous  teachers  but  they  will  never  teach 
the undergraduate students. Even though you joined 
their class, lecturers and assistants teach all of the 
lessons.  Although  you  attend  a  good  school,  your 
education  may  not  exceed  the  education  provided 
by  a  community  college  where  the  teachers  are 
more  personal  and  work  very  hard.  Sometimes 
people think that just by being a part of a powerful 
institution they will naturally be more advanced, but 
this is not necessarily the case. It depends on how 
much  one  takes  advantage  of  the  situation.  In  the 
past,  we  tended  to  think  that  because  the  institu-
tion  is  wonderful,  we  are  wonderful.  If  we  think  in 
this way, we will miss the chance to work out some 
serious  issues  and  develop  deeper  appreciation  of 
what  is  available  within  the  institution.  Devotional 
service  is  about  sadhu-sanga,  and  the  quality  of 
sadhu-sanga  determines  how  we  experience  our 
day-to-day  environment  and  experience  more  love 
and understanding of guru and Krsna.

of  the  Lord  in  a  humble  state  of 
mind,  thinking  oneself  lower  than

<span className="">This  third  sloka  of  the  Sri  Siksastaka  focuses 
on  the  procedure  and  consciousness  required  for

tolerance.  Humility  is  a  difficult  concept  to  under-
stand because it is somewhat foreign to our present 
existence  and  artificial  senses.  The  current  world

<span className="">Humility &amp; Tolerance
</span><br>
<span className="">order  is  basically  a  “take”  society  in  which  the 
fundamental patterns of interaction revolve around 
notions  of  survival  of  the  fittest  and  competition. 
The  basic  culture  of  a  material  society  revolves 
around  self-centeredness  and  individualism,  which 
involves tremendous manipulation and exploitation. 
In this type of society, one group, one person, one 
tribe  or  one  race  constantly  tries  to  capitalize  on 
others.  Material  culture  runs  in  this  way  primarily 
due  to  the  limited  nature  of  material  resources. 
When resources decrease, people become disturbed 
and fearful about the acquisition and protection of 
their  share  of  property.  Many  individuals  who  have 
accumulated  material  opulence  live  in  self-made 
prisons.  They  lock  themselves  into  big  houses  or 
mansions with burglar bars on all the windows and 
doors.  To  simply  leave  a  room,  they  often  have  to 
unlock three or four different locks. Fear of robbers 
and thieves constantly plagues their lives. This may 
even  be  a  justifiable  fear  due  to  the  value  of  their 
possessions. 
</span><br>
<span className="">The  isavasya  principle  or  the  God-centered 
conception directly opposes this type of conscious-
ness. Individuals who follow this principle accept only 
a certain quota for their maintenance, recognize the 
source of their possessions, and give proper honor 
and respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Krsna.  Humility  becomes  difficult  to  access  when 
one  lives  in  survival  consciousness.  As  we  depend 
less and less on mundane material society, we will 
live in better harmony with the natural. As we better

</span><br>
<span className="">regulate the variables in our lives, we will have some 
control of our situation and develop more apprecia-
tion for the natural. In this way, humility can develop 
more easily.
</span><br>
<span className="">In this day and time, numerous crises and conflicts 
exist as a direct result of a lack of humility. Essen-
tially,  the  survival  of  an  individual,  organization  or 
group depends on their ability to deal with conflicts 
and to quickly and efficiently resolve different prob-
lems. Spiritual life also involves conflict resolution, 
which manifests on different levels. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Destructive Conflict Resolution
</span><br>
<span className="">More  and  more  of  human  society  resorts  to 
a  destructive  level  of  conflict  resolution  that  is 
extremely demonic. The demonic position is asuram 
bhavam asritah (Bhagavad-gita 7.15). The demons 
desire to sabotage and destroy any spiritual activity. 
Their goal is to bring devastation to theism. The first, 
grossest level of conflict resolution in a competitive 
society  involves  winning  only  through  the  destruc-
tion  of  another.  In  other  words,  one  individual  can 
only achieve success through the demise or failure 
of another. This means that, as one progresses and 
achieves  certain  goals,  one  must  simultaneously 
think  about  methods  to  wipe  out  and  destroy  any 
competition.  This  position  is  especially  demonic. 
The demons want to be the lords and controllers of 
all they survey and want to thoroughly eliminate all 
competition.  Along  with  their  endeavors  to  destroy 
the  theists,  the  demons  even  fight  among  them-
</span><br>

</span><br>
<span className="">Humility &amp; Tolerance
</span><br>
<span className="">selves. Instead of co-existing in a humble manner, 
people are thinking in aggressive and nefarious ways 
and reflecting on the means to eliminate the opposi-
tion. The demons always think in this manner, even 
to the point of trying to eliminate Krsna.
</span><br>
<span className="">The  second  level  of  conflict  resolution,  which 
takes  a  small  step  beyond  the  demonic  position, 
says that I win and you lose. The demonic view feels 
that I win and I have to finish you and destroy you 
in  order  to  protect  my  own  position.  The  second 
level focuses on personal success at the expense of 
another,  but  the  competition  does  not  necessarily 
need to be destroyed. Basically, somebody is going 
to win and somebody is going to lose. A person will 
not put forth any effort to stop the opposition but, at 
the same time, he or she will not make any effort to 
help because, after all, both parties cannot win. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Spiritual Conflict Resolution
</span><br>
<span className="">The  more  humanistic,  and  ultimately  spiritual, 
conception accepts that both parties can win. This 
conception  develops  from  the  belief  that  success, 
achievement  and  sufficient  resources  are  available 
for everyone. Everything material exists and remains 
for a period of time but ultimately disappears. Spiri-
tual realities are different. When we give a spiritual 
connection  to  another  soul,  we  will  not  have  less; 
rather, we will have more. We do not need to main-
tain gross mentalities that involve actively trying to 
destroy  someone  or  trying  to  win  at  the  demise  of 
another.  Such  competitiveness  increases  when  we

<span className="">become  too  captured  by  modernity.  Competition 
exists  in  the  spiritual  world  also,  but  this  competi-
tion focuses on enhancing the services and creating 
more chances to serve Krsna with variegation. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Manifesting Humility &amp; Tolerance
</span><br>
<span className="">  In  order  to  continue  chanting  the  Lord’s  name 
and  access  the  deeper  experiences  described  in 
these  Sri  Siksastaka  prayers,  we  must  access 
humility  with  tolerance.  However,  this  task  will 
be  difficult  in  environments  that  revolve  around 
conflicts,  false  ego,  aggressiveness,  manipulation, 
control and exploitation of natural, human or finan-
cial  resources.  For  this  reason,  Srila  Prabhupada 
wanted to establish Krsna consciousness in such a 
way  that  we  do  not  have  to  depend  too  deeply  on 
the  mundane  nature  of  material  society.  Material 
society  practically  attacks  spiritual  practices  and 
attacks  the  development  of  higher  realizations  and 
connections.
</span><br>
<span className="">In order to understand the true nature of humility, 
we can first eliminate certain attributes that do not 
relate  to  humility.  First  of  all,  humility  is  not  the 
absence  of  self-esteem.  In  new  age  terminology, 
humbleness or meekness usually indicates a lack of 
self-esteem and a need for one to access their own 
power and control. Actually, a humble individual is 
not lacking in any way. Humility also surpasses mere 
tolerance of another person or situation. Sometimes, 
when  we  tolerate,  we  simply  characterize  another 
person as nonsense and see ourselves above such

</span><br>
<span className="">Humility &amp; Tolerance
</span><br>
<span className="">foolishness. We may view the other person’s behavior 
as improper, ridiculous or obnoxious and tolerate in 
this  negative  mood.  Instead  of  trying  to  help  the 
person or change the situation, we simply label and 
characterize. We imagine ourselves to be righteous 
and humble; therefore, we tolerate the other person 
who we label as a deviant. This is not humility. Self-
righteousness  is  often  the  opposite  of  humility. 
Seeing another person in this condescending mood 
is actually arrogance. Real humility does not catego-
rize without offering help—it approaches a situation 
from  different  perspectives  in  order  to  analyze  the 
problem deeper. Humility is also not blind faith. Our 
competitive  world  order  often  sees  a  humble  indi-
vidual as a weakling or blind follower who lacks the 
intelligence and creativity to make personal choices. 
Humility does not mean that one should be foolish, 
docile or easily led.
</span><br>
<span className="">Obstacles to Developing Humility
</span><br>
<span className="">We  also  need  to  examine  the  many  obstacles 
that sabotage the development of genuine humility. 
The  list  of  interferences  includes  false  pride,  false 
ego, fear, envy, lust, anger, illusion, greed and even 
insecurity.  As  we  analyze  this  list,  we  can  immedi-
ately understand the negative consequences of such 
traits.  For  instance,  when  someone  suffers  from 
false pride and feels excessively important, they will 
not be able to access deep humility. This sense of 
self-importance places the mind at the forefront, and 
this will lead one to accept the various concoctions

</span><br>
<span className="">dictated by the mind and intelligence. How can we 
act humbly with the mind in control? False ego also 
results  in  a  situation  similar  to  pride.  Fear  blocks 
humility because it leads to survival consciousness. 
Someone  who  fears  the  environment,  accepting  it 
as  precarious  and  dangerous,  cannot  be  humble. 
Instead,  their  mood  will  become  combative  and 
aggressive. Envy impedes humility because it causes 
one to feel hostile towards another individual in the 
environment.  We  will  simply  feel  disturbed  by  the 
qualities or possessions of another person. Envious-
ness,  selfishness,  self-centeredness,  pride,  false 
ego, doubt, envy, greed and illusion are a few of the 
attributes or personality traits that completely block 
the  expression  of  humility.  Unfortunately,  people 
who  have  these  traits  constantly  feel  intense  fear, 
pride or insecurity. Humility helps to ground us.
</span><br>
<span className="">After acknowledging these misconceptions about 
humility  along  with  the  various  obstacles,  we  can 
better understand that genuine humility is not a lack 
in substance or the result of weakness. Our present 
day environment causes us to think in this way due 
to  the  belief  that  successful  individuals  achieve 
greatness  through  their  expertise  in  manipulation 
and  exploitation.  Society  often  views  righteous  or 
humble individuals as irrelevant or even as failures 
since  they  may  not  maintain  a  position  of  domi-
nance. However, even the Judeo-Christian perspec-
tive  accepts  that  the  meek  shall  inherit  the  earth. 
All  the  various  religious  traditions  of  the  world 
emphasize submissiveness, meekness and humility.

<span className="">Humility &amp; Tolerance
</span><br>
<span className="">Humility  has  many  positive  sides  and  qualities.  If 
we  feel  some  insufficiency  in  our  service,  instead 
of  resorting  to  low  self-esteem,  we  can  simply  see 
others in a higher position than ourselves. Humility 
also  gives  us  an  eagerness  to  learn.  When  we  are 
free  of  the  egocentricity  of  thinking  that  we  know 
everything, we can then become humble and ready 
to receive. Furthermore, we can relinquish our claim 
to proprietorship by recognizing that all of our quali-
ties come from God and by learning to properly use 
them in His service. Humility allows a person to be 
secure.  Our  insecurities  force  us  to  react  because 
of our lack of balance or strength. Any slight distur-
bance  will  cause  more  instability.  For  example, 
when  you  lack  proper  balance,  the  harsh  words  of 
another person will naturally disturb you. However, 
when  you  have  sufficient  stability,  the  same  words 
will  seem  irrelevant  and  will  not  cause  an  overre-
action  or  unnecessary  disturbance.  In  Washington 
D.C.,  we  have  a  martial  arts  institute.  When  one 
masters certain arts of defense, one does not need 
to respond to every situation because of a personal 
awareness of one’s power. The person has the fear-
lessness  to  wait  until  the  last  minute  to  respond. 
When  we  are  strong  and  fixed  in  our  devotional 
service,  we  can  naturally  access  humility  because 
we will not feel any insecurity from the maya in the 
environment or from anyone else. Humility can also 
help  us  appreciate  our  connection  to  our  origin. 
Although  the  living  entity  is  insignificant,  the  soul 
is  still  part  and  parcel  of  the  Supreme  Personality

<span className="">of  Godhead.  In  a  secular  situation,  a  person  may 
not have much money, but if their mother or father 
has wealth, they can feel some sense of well-being. 
Although  they  may  not  have  much  capital,  their 
parents can make resources available, freeing them 
from any sense of insecurity. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Most  importantly,  humility  involves  a  genuine 
loving  heart  and  loving  sentiments.  From  this 
discussion, we can see the great complexity of real 
humility.
</span><br>
<span className="">Active Humility
</span><br>
<span className="">This third verse of the Sri Siksastaka shows that 
</span><br>
<span className="">humility is very active. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“One  should  chant  the  holy  name 
of  the  Lord  in  a  humble  state  of 
mind”  and  “should  be  ready  to  offer 
all respects to others. In such a state 
of mind one can chant the holy name 
of the Lord constantly.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">This  type  of  mindset  alone  does  not  produce  or 
maintain  humility,  which  also  depends  on  relation-
ships  and  interactions.  A  genuinely  humble  person 
does  not  tolerate  and  repress  while  maintaining 
false  ego  and  pride;  the  person  eagerly  desires  to 
glorify  and  respect  others.  This  mindset  is  not  an 
artificial imposition. Humility is not just a matter of 
tolerating  disturbances,  although  it  manifests  this 
quality.  Rather,  humility  involves  action  such  as

</span><br>
<span className="">Humility &amp; Tolerance
</span><br>
<span className="">glorifying, serving, respecting and offering homage 
to others. 
</span><br>
<span className="">We  already  dismissed  the  idea  that  humility  is 
a  weakness  or  a  type  of  dysfunction.  Accessing 
humility  can  be  intense  due  to  our  many  interfer-
ences. As we examine the interferences that hinder 
our  development  of  humility,  we  will  better  under-
stand the causes of our misfortune and inability to 
access the potency of the holy name. The Lord has 
invested all of His transcendental potency in the holy 
name, but due to our misfortune, we have no attrac-
tion. Aparadhas and namabhasa also interfere. In 
order  to  receive  all  the  available  treasures  and  to 
continue chanting with realization and experiences, 
kirtaniya sada harih, humility must come first. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Examining Our Own Humility
</span><br>
<span className="">As  we  look  at  our  own  lives  during  this  explora-
tion  of  humility,  we  need  to  first  discover  our  own 
misconceptions. We can study our consciousness to 
determine if we have a mindset of offering respect to 
others. If our meditations revolve too much around 
our own achievements or lack of achievements, we 
have not accessed humility. Sometimes we create a 
God-playing  syndrome  by  worrying  about  our  own 
deficiencies. We worry about our sickness, our lack 
of intelligence, our lack of a good husband, wife or 
child,  and  so  many  other  problems.  Our  excessive 
lamentation  is  the  complete  opposite  of  humility 
because we put our own lives in the center. If, after 
examining  our  own  consciousness,  we  find  a  lack

</span><br>
<span className="">of enthusiasm to offer respect to others or we offer 
it in a grudging mood, we can understand some of 
the  reasons  for  our  inability  to  chant  with  attach-
ment. We will simply chant mechanically and fail to 
experience  any  higher  realization  or  connection  to 
the holy name. Without proper humility, the results 
simply  will  not  manifest.  Therefore,  we  must  look 
at  our  own  pride,  ego,  fears,  illusions,  doubts  and 
self-centeredness  in  order  to  determine  our  own 
obstacles.
</span><br>
<span className="">Another aspect of humility simply involves moving 
aside and allowing Krsna and guru to drive. The lives 
of  the  great  acaryas  exemplify  this  transcendental 
aspect  of  humility.  Amazingly,  their  prayers  and 
words seem to repeatedly denigrate themselves and 
they  genuinely  think  in  this  way.  As  these  acaryas 
approach  Krsna’s  tremendous  opulence,  power, 
mercy  and  magnanimity,  they  literally  feel  unquali-
fied and unworthy to receive the overwhelming expe-
riences available to them. As the different ages pass 
from  Satya-yuga  towards  Kali-yuga,  everything 
decreases  for  the  living  entity  such  as  intelligence, 
duration  of  life,  body  size  and  the  degree  of  piety. 
The only attribute that increases is ahankara or false 
ego.  As  one  moves  farther  and  farther  away  from 
Krsna  and  His  associates,  the  false  ego  concomi-
tantly increases. All kinds of complexities arise for 
those  who  have  little  knowledge.  It  is  actually  very 
dangerous  to  associate  with  a  spiritualist  who  has 
power  but  who  lacks  humility.  The  danger  arises 
because  real  devotional  strength  and  a  genuine

<span className="">spiritual  connection  cannot  exist  without  humility. 
Spiritualism  and  great  power  without  humility  will 
result  in  exploitation,  manipulation  and  abuse.  At 
worst,  the  power  will  stem  from  demonic  connec-
tions  because  demons  are  also  powerful  control-
lers. However, they utilize their control, potency and 
power for destruction and devastation. When you see 
great spiritual strength without humility, be careful. 
This  consciousness  indicates  that  the  individuals 
view themselves as God’s gift to the planet and fail 
to  value  others  due  to  personal  conceit.  When  we 
observe the mood of actual vrajavasis, the mood of 
the gosvamis, and the mood of genuine devotees, 
we will discover large amounts of love and respect 
for each other. This mood is not artificial or a type 
of  mental  gymnastics  that  requires  rigorous  work; 
rather, it is a natural result of genuine humility. On 
the other hand, the demigods have great power and 
lack humility, which naturally results in fear amongst 
them.  The  demigods  often  attack  one  another  or 
attack  other  living  entities  that  threaten  their  high 
posts  in  the  material  world.  One  may  have  a  lead-
ership  position  and  even  chant  the  holy  name  but 
excessive  false  pride,  fear  or  illusion  will  result  in 
this type of combativeness instead of appreciation. 
In this situation, we will only find manipulation and 
autocratic  power  play.  These  negative  attributes 
prevent us from relishing the holy name. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Basically, we need to move out of the way and let 
guru  and  Krsna  drive.  We  need  to  make  ourselves 
available to accept and receive what is always acces-

</span><br>
<span className="">sible, and humility readies us to receive. Krsna and 
His  agents  eagerly  want  to  share  and  to  give  but, 
without  sufficient  humility,  we  bring  in  different 
patterns  of  obfuscation.  The  practice  of  humility 
can  compare  to  the  process  of  bhakti  since  these 
are not sentimental practices. Bhakti takes certain 
prerequisites  such  as  knowledge  and  austerity  in 
order to surrender. If we feel insecure or fearful or do 
not have knowledge, we cannot surrender. We must 
have  knowledge  in  the  sense  of  understanding  the 
purpose of our engagements. Our devotional service 
will have greater potency if we act in the proper way 
with  the  proper  knowledge  or  consciousness.  On 
the other hand, if we only accidentally act properly, 
the  action  will  not  have  the  same  potency  as  an 
action performed in knowledge. Surrender includes 
all  such  things  with  humility  in  the  forefront.  For 
this reason, New Age philosophy can be dangerous 
since it teaches that: “I am god,” “you are god,” “he 
is  god”  or  “she  is  god.”  It  teaches  that  we  simply 
should  follow  our  own  truth  and  respect  everyone 
else’s truth. In this way, we can all be gods. But, real 
humility  understands  the  presence  of  a  Supreme 
Absolute Truth. Recognition of an Absolute Truth is 
not just dogma. There is an absolute loving Godhead 
who  tries  to  make  that  love  available,  and  we  are 
interfering  with  this  love.  We  must  stop  interfering 
and open ourselves up to receive. Humbleness gives 
us the ability to receive. If someone tries to give us 
a gift but we feel uncomfortable with the person, the 
environment  or  the  packaging,  we  may  not  accept

<span className="">the gift. Doubt and fear are very inimical to bhakti, 
but if we try to artificially rid ourselves of these stag-
nations, they will simply turn into blind faith. Instead 
of  blindly  jumping  in  and  out  of  different  activities 
or processes, we should pursue an investigation and 
then intensely commit in order to receive. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Lower Than the Straw in the Street
</span><br>
<span className="">“One should chant the holy name of the Lord in 
a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than 
the straw in the street.” This is quite a low position. 
“One should be more tolerant than a tree.” Modern 
psychology would probably view this type of person 
as dysfunctional, suffering in a state of neurosis or 
psychosis. This type of person would  seem to  lack 
self-esteem. The condition of seeing oneself as lower 
than the straw in the street might sound miserable. 
Straw  is  insignificant,  blown  around  by  the  wind 
and  driven  over  by  cars.  Even  though  we  should 
feel ourselves insignificant, we should notice others 
and offer respects. We should not need respect, and 
we should even fear too much praise. For example, 
Madhavendra  Puri  would  run  away  if  someone 
excessively  praised  him.  Although  he  was  so  dear 
to the Deity that the Deity spoke to him, he did not 
want to be known nor did he desire any praise, so 
he  would  simply  leave  the  area.  In  this  conscious-
ness,  one  does  not  claim  proprietorship,  realizing 
that  everything  results  from  Krsna’s  blessings  and 
mercy.  Material  consciousness  cannot  contaminate 
a person who deeply honors the Lord in this way and

</span><br>
<span className="">returns  everything  to  Him.  Material  consciousness 
is an environment for thieves and rogues who claim 
proprietorship. If we had something that belongs to 
another person and claim it as our own, we would be 
considered  thieves.  Krsna  gives  everything  but  the 
materialists deny His existence and claim everything 
as  their  own.  Conversely,  one  may  abandon  this 
consciousness  but  still  not  attain  genuine  humility 
if  one  simply  feels  materially  useless,  worthless  or 
suicidal. An alcoholic or a drug addict may feel worth-
less, viewing themselves as nothing and losing hope 
for the future, but real spiritual insignificance means 
recognizing the greatness of God. One will feel small 
and  insignificant  next  to  the  greatness  of  God  and 
the  magnificence  of  the  spiritual  paradigm.  This 
feeling of insignificance will cause us to feel distant 
from  the  spiritual  realities,  but  will  simultaneously 
increase  our  desire  to  experience  these  spiritual 
realities.  If  we  think  that  we  have  already  attained 
the higher platform, we will not work hard to acquire 
it. If we feel that it is not accessible, we will also not 
endeavor  very  seriously.  Acknowledging  our  insig-
nificance  and  our  distance  from  spiritual  realities 
allows  us  to  appreciate  the  goal  and  move  swiftly 
towards it. The Chinese conception of humility is the 
capacity  to  experience  awe.  This  is  an  interesting 
concept.  A  proud  individual  will  not  have  this  awe 
or wonder because they will feel that nothing exists 
beyond  their  own  activities,  knowledge  or  percep-
tions.  Nothing  will  excite  such  individuals  unless  it 
applies to their own experience or arena of control.

<span className="">How  can  people  understand  the  Supreme  Person-

</span><br>
<span className="">More Tolerant Than a Tree
</span><br>
<span className="">The  second  part  of  this  prayer  focuses  on  toler-
ance. “One should be more tolerant than a tree.” In 
the Caitanya-caritamrta, Antya-lila 20.22-26, it is 
stated: 
</span><br>
<span className="">“These  are  the  symptoms  of  one 
who  chants  the  Hare  Krsna  maha-
mantra.  Although  he  is  very  exalted, 
he  thinks  himself  lower  than  the 
grass on the ground, and like a tree, 
he tolerates everything in two ways. 
When a tree is cut down, it does not 
protest, and even when drying up, it 
does  not  ask  anyone  for  water.  The 
tree  delivers  its  fruits,  flowers  and 
whatever else it possesses to anyone 
and  everyone.  It  tolerates  scorching 
heat  and  torrents  of  rain,  yet  it  still 
gives  shelter  to  others.  Although  a 
Vaisnava  is  the  most  exalted  person, 
he  is  prideless  and  gives  all  respect 
to  everyone,  knowing  everyone  to 
be  the  resting  place  of  Krsna.  If  one 
chants  the  holy  name  of  Lord  Krsna 
in  this  manner,  he  will  certainly

<span className="">awaken his dormant love for Krsna’s 
lotus feet.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">This is an active position. Not only does the tree 
not  refuse  to  give,  it  offers  everything  without  any 
grudges  or  anxieties.  Humility  involves  more  than 
just  refraining  from  certain  acts.  Humility  requires 
positive actions in terms of one’s eagerness to serve, 
help and give shelter to others, and to perform these 
services with great happiness. An actual devotee is 
param-duhkha-duhkhi krpam buddhi, they feel the 
pain  and  suffering  of  others  and  also  their  happi-
ness.  If  someone  suffers,  they  have  the  ability  to 
empathize  because  they  genuinely  care.  They  do 
not see themselves as separate but feel connected 
due  to  their  understanding  of  the  ultimate  source, 
God.  They  have  deep  sensitivity  to  the  parts  and 
parcels  of  the  Lord  who  manifest  in  various  ways. 
Do we feel happy or excited to see another devotee 
excelling  in  their  spiritual  life  when  we  have  not 
excelled? Do we feel excited to see someone nicely 
performing his or her service, having good fortune, 
or  experiencing  a  type  of  boon?  Or  do  we  believe 
that  we  deserve  these  benefits  instead?  We  might 
feel  we  are  more  qualified  because  we  have  been 
devotees  longer,  work  harder,  could  perform  the 
service better or could more efficiently use the gift. 
How often do these thoughts come into our minds 
instead of feelings of excitement over the success of 
another? We can look at this type of consciousness 
in  the  most  simplistic  terms.  For  example,  maybe

<span className="">only a small amount of maha or prasadam remains 
from the last meal. Will we consider the other people 
in  the  hallway  and  serve  them  first?  The  genuinely 
humble  person  will  naturally  think  this  way  all  the 
time or at least, most of the time. Instead, we may 
see this small amount of prasadam or our favorite 
preparation  and  endeavor  to  get  our  share  before 
anyone else comes. Our consciousness is about the 
aggregate  of  all  our  small  actions.  We  do  not  have 
to  be  masochists  or  sadists,  suffering  and  putting 
ourselves  in  miserable  situations  just  to  feel  like 
martyrs or victims. But, when we have a chance to 
share, do we think about the other person’s welfare 
as much as or more than our own? If these positive 
reflections are not a dominant part of our conscious-
ness,  these  obstacles  will  interfere  with  our  ability 
to chant or to access deeper experiences from the 
actual  chanting.  This  consciousness  is  natural  and 
fully exhibited by the residents of Vrndavana. They 
always think in this mood of being all for Krsna and 
His servants. The false ego does not exist in them.

<span className="">or  the  boss.  One  should  not  forget 
himself  as  a  humble  servant  even 
though one is addressed as prabhu.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">In  our  normal  exchanges,  we  call  each  other 
prabhu or master, emphasizing our position as servi-
tors. But those who think of themselves as prabhu, 
as sannyasi, or as guru are in a fallen state, because 
they  view  themselves  as  proprietor  and  master. 
Although someone may call us prabhu, in our own 
minds we should see ourselves as a servant. Other-
wise there is stagnation. A guru should not think, “I 
am guru and this is my disciple who should serve me 
and take my word as the absolute.” A guru should 
think, “By the mercy of my guru, I get Krsna.” And 
the disciple should also think, “By the mercy of my 
guru, I get Krsna.” All these types of mindsets deter-
mine  our  level  of  pride,  false  ego,  imbalance,  fear 
or  illusion,  which  checks  humility.  Yes,  we  do  call 
each other prabhu but we should not accept that for 
ourselves. Srila Prabhupada again writes in a letter 
to Brahmananda on November 15, 1967:  
</span><br>
<span className="">“The  idea  is  that  personally,  one 
should  be  very  meek  and  humble 
even  in  the  presence  of  greatest 
provocation,  but  a  slight  insult  to 
Krsna  or  His  representative  should 
at  once  be  taken  seriously  and 
appropriate  measures  should  be 
taken.”

<span className="">Humility &amp; Tolerance
</span><br>
<span className="">Again,  humility  does  not  mean  avoidance  or 
denial.  In  some  situations,  humility  even  means  to 
act  aggressively  in  the  sense  of  being  truthful  and 
concerned about the ultimate well-being of others. A 
person may avoid addressing a certain issue, consid-
ering this to be humility, but by remaining quiet, he 
or  she  actually  does  a  disservice  to  another  or  to 
the  environment  by  reinforcing  some  nonsense.  In 
these situations, humbleness means to not care for 
the  likes  and  dislikes  of  another,  to  not  endeavor 
to simply please a personality and to not endeavor 
for the sentimental approval of another. We should 
really  care  about  their  higher  needs.  If  you  see 
me  every  week  smoking  cigarettes  or  marijuana, 
but  you  feign  humility  by  pretending  not  to  see  or 
notice the situation, you are not really humble. We 
might think that by bringing up an issue, the other 
person will become our enemy. We may think, “He 
is  a  sannyasi  and  I  don’t  want  to  tell  anyone  that 
he  is  smoking  marijuana.  Instead,  I  am  just  going 
to follow the philosophy and be humble.” This is not 
actual humility. Humility means that we eagerly serve 
others  by  helping  them  understand  their  improper 
actions. It means speaking up in order to bring the 
other person to a higher level.

<span className="">1968 from Srila Prabhupada.

</span><br>
<span className="">Setting the Example
</span><br>
<span className="">On  March  3,  1968,  Prabhupada  wrote 
</span><br>
<span className="">to 
</span><br>
<span className="">Hamsaduta and Himavati:
</span><br>
<span className="">“One  should  never 
</span><br>
<span className="">‘Oh, 
I  have  seen  Krsna,  and  so  I  am 
reached perfection.’ This is not Krsna 
consciousness.”
</span><br>
<span className="">feel, 
</span><br>
<span className="">The  Nectar  of  Devotion  explains  that  when  one 
advances  from  the  platform  of  sadhana-bhakti  to 
bhava and prema, one should continue to act in the 
spirit  of  trying  to  become  perfect.  Why?  One  must 
avoid  sahajiyaism.  Furthermore,  Srila  Bhaktisid-
dhanta Sarasvati Thakura explains that one should 
not  reveal  their  bhajana.  What  does  this  mean? 
When someone reaches the level of penetrating the 
three  modes  of  material  nature,  in  order  to  avoid 
cheating  mentalities,  to  avoid  confusing  neophytes 
and to avoid minimization of healthy rules and regu-
lations, one should continue following the rules and 
regulations  in  order  to  prevent  disturbances  in  the 
environment. 
</span><br>
<span className="">It is not that Srila Prabhupada had to chant Hare 
Krsna. He was always thinking of Krsna. It is not that 
he  had  to  read  books,  but  he  read  his  own  books 
as well as many other acaryas’ books. It is not that

<span className="">those activities were necessary. It is not that in the 
spiritual  world  everyone  has  to  follow  structured 
rules  and  regulations.  Acting  in  the  right  way  is 
simply  natural  and  spontaneous.  Krsna  conscious-
ness is more than just rules and regulations or do’s 
and  don’ts.  In  our  unnatural  state,  we  need  many 
rules to help us develop the proper balance in order 
to  become  natural  and  spontaneous.  However,  if 
such  people  who  have  fully  attained  this  level  in 
their bodies act accordingly, they will simply cause 
disturbances. To the average person, a pure devotee 
would  seem  like  a  madman  due  to  their  constant 
absorption  in  great  expressions  of  Krsna’s  love; 
therefore,  they  tone  themselves  down.  However,  if 
we  investigate  Srila  Prabhupada’s  life,  we  will  find 
different  cases  where  he  did  not  always  fully  hide 
the ecstasy. 
</span><br>
<span className="">We  often  see  that  the  mystic,  the  psychic  or  the 
pseudo-religionist  is  very  eager  to  talk  about  their 
experiences.  Different  New  Age  groups  often  talk 
extensively  about  their  experiences  during  medita-
tion,  channeling,  dreaming  or  during  other  situa-
tions. Everyone wants to show that their experience 
is greater and that they are more divine. They eagerly 
boast  even  when  they  have  nothing.  Unfortunately, 
the  environment  often  focuses  on  the  discussion 
of  these  experiences,  which  can  result  in  pretense 
and  artificiality.  Some  people  may  even  pretend  to 
have had similar experiences in order to share and 
discuss. At certain levels, experiences can no longer 
be  discussed  but  simply  must  be  experienced.  In

</span><br>
<span className="">these letters, Srila Prabhupada emphasizes that one 
should never feel that they own Krsna, or have seen 
Krsna or have reached perfection. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Haridasa  Thakura  thought,  “If  I  do  not  finish  all 
of my rounds, I will fall into maya.” As a direct resi-
dent from the spiritual world, he was seeing Krsna. 
The  gosvamis  were  manjaris  and  always  cried 
for  Radha  and  Krsna  even  though  they  were  in  full 
possession  of  Them.  Instead  of  feeling  themselves 
to be worthy proprietors, they were always in a state 
of unfolding. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Srila Prabhupada writes to Krsna dasa on June 1, 
</span><br>
<span className="">1968:
</span><br>
<span className="">“This  humbleness  is  the  sign  of 
progress  in  Krsna  consciousness. 
A  Krsna  conscious  person  thinks 
always  about  himself  as  the  lowest 
creature  in  the  world,  and  the  more 
one  thinks  like  that  he  becomes 
elevated more and more.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">To  Himavati  on  June  14,  Prabhupada  says,  “But 
because  somebody  is  calling  you  prabhu,  one 
should  not  become  a  prabhu  and  treat  others 
as  servants.”  Sometimes  we  see  a  devotee  who 
develops  this  spirit  and  thinks,  “I  am  a  brahmana 
and have to go study. Ask Bhakta Jim to sweep the 
floor. I’m beyond that because I’m a brahmana!” Or 
we get into a similar consciousness, thinking, “Oh, I 
have arrived. You are asking me? Can’t you see my

</span><br>
<span className="">cloth? I am a sannyasi.” Actually, one should have 
the  opposite  mindset,  acting  as  the  servant  and 
eager to serve.
</span><br>
<span className="">Srila Prabhupada writes to Malati:
</span><br>
<span className="">“I  thank  you  very  much  for  your 
nice  letter  of  October  29,  1968,  and 
I  have  noted  your  nice  sentiments. 
Yes,  we  should  always  think  ourself 
as the most fallen, the most ignorant, 
and  it  is  simply  by  the  mercy  of 
Lord Caitanya that we have even the 
opportunity to serve Krsna.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">These thoughts do not indicate foolishness. If we 
genuinely  feel  unworthy,  we  will  diligently  work  on 
ourselves to become worthy. These feelings of unwor-
thiness  will  help  us  work  hard  to  appreciate,  value 
and cherish that which is available. If we believe that 
we deserve something and even deserved it earlier, 
the same appreciation will not set in. If we feel that 
we obtained certain results due to our own endeavor 
and believe that we should have received even more, 
we  have  a  very  dangerous  mindset.  If  we  use  our 
current facilities properly and have sufficient appre-
ciation, Krsna will give more. 
</span><br>
<span className="">If  one  receives  more  facility  for  executing  spiri-
tual activities in a spiritual environment but fails to 
simultaneously  develop  more  humility,  this  extra 
facility  will  simply  electrocute  the  person.  When  a 
person  receives  more  opulence,  he  or  she  cannot

</span><br>
<span className="">remain  in  the  same  consciousness.  This  pertains 
directly  to  our  present  situation  in  our  movement 
and  in  our  own  lives,  because  as  we  receive  more 
responsibility,  more  manpower  or  more  money, 
we  must  constantly  increase  our  humility.  Without 
humility,  the  false  ego  will  increase,  encouraging 
one to use, manipulate and deal with the facility in 
a self-centered spirit. The ego will cause the person 
to feel like the lord of all they survey and the cause 
of  all  their  extra  facilities.  Often  people  fall  due  to 
this  type  of  mentality.  Sometimes  a  fall  does  not 
directly result from the object of sense gratification, 
which  externally  causes  the  fall;  rather,  it  results 
from  this  disease  of  pride  and  false  ego.  Lack  of 
humility  may  allow  a  situation  to  come  upon  a 
person, and they will then not have the resistance to 
counteract the attack. We can sometimes see these 
situations manifest when a devotee falls due to illicit 
sex,  money  or  another  type  of  sense  gratification. 
In Arjuna’s case, once Krsna left the planet, a situa-
tion that normally would have never bothered him, 
defeated him. When our resistance gets weak, a fall 
can occur. Lack of humility weakens our defenses. 
For  this  reason,  a  person  with  power,  but  without 
humility, is like a time bomb. It is only a matter of 
time before there is a serious fall. It will be gradual 
at  first  since  they  will  justify  all  types  of  behavior. 
Although  they  will  continue  to  use  their  environ-
ment, manpower and facilities in so many wonderful 
ways, their personal spiritual life will be checked at 
some  point,  resulting  in  a  fall.  The  gifts  that  Krsna

</span><br>
<span className="">Humility &amp; Tolerance
</span><br>
<span className="">gives  are  powerful,  comparable  to  electricity.  Elec-
tricity is very powerful; therefore, we have to use the 
cord properly by covering it with insulation so that it 
will not shock or electrocute us. A fall is Krsna’s way 
to expose an improper connection so that one can 
rectify the situation or consciousness.
</span><br>
<span className="">Unfortunately, when a person falls due to a lack of 
humility, it will be more difficult to pick themselves 
up again because the same problem now compounds 
the situation. In other words, when you fall or have 
a  difficulty,  it  takes  humility  to  pick  yourself  up 
again.  Although  devotees  forgive,  we  unfortunately 
do not forget so easily. So, when a person falls and 
everyone knows that the person fell, he or she will 
have difficulty in picking themselves up, because in 
most  cases,  lack  of  humility  allowed  certain  prob-
lems to build and cause the fall. However, if we serve 
Krsna  with  sufficient  humility,  then  Krsna,  through 
the mercy of Lord Nityananda, will  give protection. 
In Kali-yuga, it is practically impossible to become 
very  strong  in  the  process.  Nevertheless,  maya 
is  a  servant  of  Krsna,  and  as  we  surrender  to  the 
parampara  system,  we  will  have  protection  just  as 
one under an umbrella receives protection from the 
rain.  When  Indra  attacked  the  residents  of  Vrnda-
vana with torrents of rain, Krsna lifted Govardhana 
Hill and gave protection to those under His shelter. 
Just because we have involved ourselves in such a 
high level spiritual process does  not  mean that we 
will not be attacked. The demons will try to attack 
even more. In war, you go for the generals, trying to

</span><br>
<span className="">sabotage  and  destroy  as  much  as  possible.  There-
fore,  anything  powerful  in  the  Hare  Krsna  move-
ment will draw some of the most powerful demonic 
attacks. Demons know where to find spirituality, but 
if we are under shelter, the attacks will not affect us. 
Conversely,  if  we  have  not  placed  ourselves  under 
the proper shelter, the demons feel very happy. They 
think, “Oh, you try to declare war against us without 
any weapons, but we will finish you off right away.” 
When  we  involve  ourselves  in  the  actual  culture  of 
devotion  with  too  much  pride  or  lack  of  humility, 
it  means  that  we  have  put  on  our  uniforms  for  the 
adversary to see, but we have no weapons. Will the 
enemy say, “Go back and get your weapons. Go back 
and  fortify  yourself  and  then  come  and  fight.”  No. 
The adversary will see us as an easy target and will 
quickly finish us off. If we want to battle with maya 
without humility, she will attack very heavily.
</span><br>
<span className="">Lord Caitanya has explained:
</span><br>
<span className="">“One  should  chant  the  holy  name 
of  the  Lord  in  a  humble  state  of 
mind,  thinking  oneself  lower  than 
the  straw  in  the  street;  one  should 
be  more  tolerant  than  a  tree,  devoid 
of  all  sense  of  false  prestige,  and 
should  be  ready  to  offer  all  respect 
to others. In such a state of mind one 
can chant the holy name of the Lord 
constantly.”

<span className="">Questions &amp; Answers
Question:  I  often  have  problems  with  tolerance. 
I  notice  that  I  will  be  tolerant,  but  in  the  mood  of 
thinking myself to be better than the other person. 
Then I will try to tolerate nonsense over and over, but 
tolerance  finally  becomes  too  much  and  I  become 
angry. In this case, I am trying to be humble and the 
other  person  can  see  this,  but  still  they  constantly 
try  to  attack  me.  Should  I  keep  this  position?  How 
can I deal with this situation? 
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: Humility is not foolishness or the reinforce-
ment of nonsense. It does not help to function in a 
way  that  reinforces  another  person’s  offenses.  On 
the other hand, we need to examine ourselves. Are 
we just repressing and tolerating but really thinking 
that the other person is wrong? Or do we consider 
that  we  ourselves  could  be  wrong?  Do  we  really 
relate properly to sadhu, sastra and guru? Or have 
we concocted our own ideas of right and wrong? Do 
we function according to our own prestige or posi-
tion? If someone disagrees with our self-image and 
does not accept our guidance or instruction, but we 
feel that they must accept since we have the answers, 
we really need to look closer at the dynamics of our 
interactions. Then, we simply do our best and we are 
held responsible.

<span className="">Question:  If  they  act  in  this  way,  should  we  be 
honest and confront the situation to prevent it from 
continuing?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: The best way to help is through one’s own 
good  example.  Then,  we  can  offer  some  advice  or 
assistance but not in a condescending way. We offer 
our help as a service, not feeling categorically sure 
that we understand the situation, and not attached 
to  the  results.  We  are  servants  of  each  other  and 
responsible for each other, so we should not ignore a 
problem. We have a duty to perform, but at the same 
time, we should not look for faults or weakness and 
simply criticize. If we engage in faultfinding, another 
person’s  problems  may  help  us  to  feel  superior 
since we do not have the same problem. Sometimes 
devotees eagerly examine the problems of another 
because they want to feel superior or feel that their 
own problem is not so serious. For example, I may 
smoke marijuana once a week, but justify the action 
because other people smoke every single day. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: You described earlier that low self-esteem 
is not wanted. Is there a type of lose-win philosophy 
that  says,  “It  is  too  much  trouble  to  deal  with  this 
strong person so I will just let them lord over me?” 
I  categorized  this  as  humility,  but  in  fact,  it  seems 
to be based on low self-esteem. I may take the so-
called humble position but it never satisfies me.

<span className="">you  remain  unsatisfied,  but  you  will  also  reinforce 
the  person’s  position  of  nonsense  and  dominance. 
In this sense, your behavior will actually add to the 
problem. One can be humble in this situation by not 
becoming  angry  or  disturbed,  but  not  by  accom-
modating something improper. We cannot force an 
issue,  but  just  bring  it  up  according  to  your  under-
standing and the person will act with their free will. 
In this way, you are neither reinforcing their behavior 
nor  experiencing  anxiety  and  distress  from  the 
situation.  Encountering  an  improper  situation  and 
internalizing  it  will  simply  cause  you  frustration, 
which can result in all sorts of sicknesses. When you 
accommodate improper things, it eats away at your 
health in different ways.
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: We hear in the philosophy that we should 
not associate with people who are nonsense, but it 
seems that these are the very people who need our 
association.
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: Although we may be around them, the idea 
is to give our association rather than accept improper 
things from them. If we preach to a gambler, butcher 
or  anyone  engaged  in  sinful  activity,  we  should  try 
to  help,  share  and  give  without  picking  up  their 
patterns.  We  are  more  or  less  giving  our  associa-
tion without taking theirs. Preaching always involves 
some  risk  and  some  contamination;  therefore,  we 
should  move  into  such  situations  with  caution,  not 
letting our guard down or getting too comfortable. If

<span className="">we become too relaxed and accept the environment, 
we will become like the environment. Although  we 
have to work in all types of environments, a devotee 
must  feel  foreign  in  any  place  bereft  of  the  glorifi-
cation  of  the  Lord.  More  and  more  devotees  work 
outside  and  have  to  associate  with  all  kinds  of 
karmis. Even on sankirtana we sometimes have to 
go  to  the  most  sinful  places.  If  one  identifies  with 
the environment, it gets dangerous. The association 
must be in the spirit of “transcendental espionage” 
as agents for Krsna and we must act in this way. We 
must remind ourselves of our connection, commit-
ments and responsibilities. We are working on behalf 
of guru and Krsna and should have the conscious-
ness that they are always watching us. Would they be 
happy with my involvement in this behavior? Would 
they appreciate my current activity? We can evaluate 
association in this sense. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: I sometimes like to involve myself in the 
healing arts field and New Age arena. I often think 
of the many merging psychologies and philosophies 
that  appear  interesting  and  attractive,  and  I  like  to 
see  them  in  relationship  to  Krsna  consciousness. 
One  of  them  involves  the  idea  of  self-acceptance. 
This is an important aspect of psychology and New 
Age  thinking.  In  terms  of  Krsna  consciousness,  I 
think  that  self-acceptance  means  letting  Krsna  be 
Krsna  and  letting  us  accept  ourselves  as  we  are—
servants of God.

have  absolutes  or  the  understanding  of  goals.  The 
basis of the therapy focuses on helping the person 
become  comfortable  with  themselves  as  they  are. 
They do not view many activities as improper, so they 
will treat you by helping you to feel comfortable with 
your  deviations.  The  therapist  helps  you  to  accept 
your  situation.  This  is  dangerous  for  us,  because 
instead of focusing on pleasing God, we will focus on 
that which helps us feel comfortable with ourselves. 
Consequentially,  we  will  look  for  peace  instead  of 
realization,  or  individual  and  collective  pleasures 
instead  of  service.  In  this  way,  they  teach  people 
to be non-judgmental and to honor all situations so 
that everyone can function together nicely. Although 
this is not in any way transcendental, it is still better 
than  the  mode  of  ignorance.  People  simply  want 
to  become  complacent  by  reducing  their  anxieties 
in  relation  to  their  problems.  There  is  a  difference 
between  crisis  management  and  crisis  resolution. 
Without  understanding  real  spiritual  goals,  people 
will  remain  in  the  prison  and  try  to  suffer  peace-
fully.  A  person  in  prison  suffers  from  confinement, 
but  instead  of  getting  free  from  the  pain,  the  idea 
is to continue suffering peacefully with less distrac-
tion. If we have a toothache, we can use painkillers 
again and again to dull the pain, or we can solve the 
problem  permanently  by  having  the  tooth  filled  or 
extracted, even though that may involve serious pain 
and inconvenience for several days.

<span className="">In  devotional  service,  we  do  not  simply  want 
to  create  cosmetic  arrangements  for  temporary 
comfort. We want to deeply look at our issues, gross 
as  well  as  subtle,  and  make  necessary  transitions. 
It  is  difficult  because  our  environments  are  often 
inimical  to  such  deep  introspection.  This  type  of 
investigation  may  even  disturb  other  people.  Many 
spiritualists  or  spiritually  inclined  individuals  may 
think  or  say,  “You  don’t  have  to  get  that  involved.” 
Sometimes  our  own  friends  and  relatives  will  ask, 
“Are you still in the Hare Krsna movement? Haven’t 
you had enough of that?” It becomes difficult when 
someone  deeply  involves  themselves  in  a  process 
but the environment is constantly challenging them. 
Most people want to use God in order to be happy. 
Even  some  theists  approach  Krsna  with  wants  and 
needs, hoping that the Lord will make arrangements 
for  them.  They  may  want  the  heavenly  connection, 
more enjoyment or less interference with their sense 
gratification  rather  than  genuine  spiritual  life.  They 
think,  “Now  that  I  have  turned  to  God,  I  will  get 
relief  from  those  things  interfering  with  my  enjoy-
ment. Therefore I will make this prayer.” Being tran-
scendental means passing far beyond this mentality 
and accessing a real sense of humility. It is difficult 
in  environments  that  focus  on  competition  and 
self-centeredness  and  deal  with  limited  resources. 
From the spiritual perspective, unlimited resources 
exist,  along  with  love  and  knowledge,  but  we  have 
to  remove  the  barriers  and  interferences.  We  can 
access humility simply by removing the blocks, and

<span className="">this will open us to receive. Krsna wants to give, but 
if our hands remain tied by false ego, pride, lust or 
fear,  we  cannot  accept.  Once  we  get  rid  of  these 
anarthas,  we  will  be  able  to  receive.  Therefore, 
true humility puts us in a position to be the greatest 
receivers of Krsna’s and guru’s mercy in unlimited 
ways.

</span><br>
<span className="">First  we  will  examine  the  proposition  of  desire. 
When people hear that we avoid gambling, intoxica-
tion, illicit sex and meat eating, they often wonder, 
“Then, what do you do? What is left?” Since people 
pursue these activities for fun and stimulation, even 
as the goal of life itself, no fulfillment seems possible 
beyond them. If they can increase their involvement 
in these areas, life is wonderful, but if they cannot, 
life  is  miserable  due  to  a  lack  of  sensual  stimula-
tion.  For  instance,  the  university  is  supposedly  an

<span className="">Wanting Only Devotional Service
</span><br>
<span className="">atmosphere  of  intellectual  investigation  and  devel-
opment, but in most cases, the environment simply 
increases one’s sense gratification. For many people, 
the height of their sense gratification occurs during 
this  period  of  their  lives.  College  students  are  not 
exactly children, but they are normally not yet adults 
burdened  by  numerous  responsibilities  such  as 
paying  bills  and  maintaining  a  family.  People  often 
involve  themselves  in  drugs  and  promiscuity  more 
during  this  period  than  during  any  other  period  of 
their lives.
</span><br>
<span className="">As  devotees  of  this  Hare  Krsna  movement,  we 
do  not  oppose  desires,  because  only  a  dead  man 
has absolutely no desires. Desires always exist, but 
the significant factor is the direction in which these 
desires  focus.  The  Buddhists  strive  to  suppress  or 
eliminate  desire.  In  some  Buddhist  asramas,  they 
meditate  all  day,  without  movement,  in  order  to 
ultimately free themselves of all desires and stimu-
lation.  Actually,  complete  desirelessness  is  impos-
sible.  If  we  place  a  person  in  a  completely  white 
room with little stimulation for the mind and intelli-
gence, the individual will eventually begin to halluci-
nate. Activity and expression are natural parts of the 
soul. If the mind is simply neglected in this way and 
the senses are cut off from activity, they will create 
their  own  activity  to  reflect  on.  We  do  not  just  tell 
people  to  stop  their  activities  with  no  alternatives. 
We do not see ultimate satisfaction in merely elimi-
nating activity. People think that spiritual life is the 
opposite of material life, meaning that if material life

</span><br>
<span className="">is full of variety, heterogeneity, misery and suffering, 
spiritual life must mean the negation of this variety. 
However, spiritual life is not the opposite of anything. 
The spiritual does not exist simply as the opposite 
or the converse of the so-called material reality. The 
spiritual is the actual reality and material life is the 
perverted reflection.
</span><br>
<span className="">Desires Separate From Krsna
</span><br>
<span className="">This  fourth  sloka  discusses  anyabhilasa  or 
desires  separate  from  Krsna,  which  lead  one  to 
imprisonment  in  the  coverings  of  illusion.  For 
instance,  even  when  the  altar  doors  close  and  the 
partition  separates  us  from  the  altar,  the  activity 
still  continues  behind  the  doors.  Improper  desires 
create a covering that obstructs proper contact with 
the higher. They do not eliminate or stop the connec-
tion but they cause obfuscation. When we relinquish 
motivations,  desires  and  aspirations  outside  of 
devotional  service  and  simply  try  to  please  Krsna, 
the curtain or divider will open to a degree propor-
tionate to our freedom from unwanted desires.  We 
want  to  come  to  the  level  of  unmotivated,  uninter-
rupted devotion. At this point, we will no longer be 
under the subjugation of the three modes of mate-
rial  nature.  We  will  no  longer  be  subjected  to  our 
likes  and  dislikes,  to  the  bodily  conception  of  life, 
aham  mameti,  or  to  the  mentality  of  lording  over 
material nature.

women  [or  handsome  men],  nor  do 
I  want  any  number  of  followers.  I 
only want Your causeless devotional 
service, birth after birth.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">This  verse  would  sound  very  strange  to  a  so-
called  “normal”  or  secular  person.  Somebody  who 
is not pursuing sex for gratification? Somebody who 
does  not  want  people  to  cheer  them  on?  The  so-
called  normal  person  would  see  this  individual  as 
dysfunctional and most unfortunate, with no sense 
of achievement or purpose in life. An individual who 
does  not  pursue  these  “natural”  goals  would  seem 
existential.  In  one  sense  this  is  true,  because  one 
who  does  not  pursue  the  goals  of  modern  civiliza-
tion  may  be  categorized  as  mentally  disturbed  or 
even  crazy.  In  one  sense,  everyone  is  crazy,  either 
materially  or  spiritually,  but  it  just  depends  on  the 
type of craziness. The materialists are crazy about 
temporary stimulation, gratification and enjoyment. 
The  eyes  want  to  enjoy  and  experience  various 
objects, the nose wants to experience nice aromas 
and  the  tongue  desires  to  taste  nice,  palatable 
foods. The belly always hankers for satisfaction and 
the  genitals  always  desire  contact.  Our  senses  are 
constantly pushing us. They constantly and viciously 
push us and never reach satisfaction. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Crazed Pursuit of Sense Gratification
</span><br>
<span className="">The conditioned living entity is in a crazed state,

<span className="">Reflections On Sacred Teachings, Volume One
</span><br>
<span className="">trying  to  find  new  kinds  of  sense  gratification  and 
constantly  making  arrangements  for  the  senses. 
This  is  craziness.  The  living  entity  is  pushed  and 
forced  to  act  wildly,  irrationally  and  sporadically. 
On the other hand, spiritual absorption also results 
in craziness. This lack of desire for material things 
seems  abnormal,  but  this  type  of  craziness  is 
madness  for  Krsna’s  love,  madness  to  hear  about 
Krsna’s pastimes and madness to gaze upon Krsna’s 
various  forms.  Do  you  think  the  suddha-bhakta, 
the unalloyed devotee, is not mad? These devotees 
are completely mad, entirely addicted to Krsna, and 
intensely  desire  to  hear  about  Krsna.  Their  only 
solace  comes  from  their  connection  with  Krsna. 
Everything else is void of any real satisfaction.
</span><br>
<span className="">We have the free will to choose our type of crazi-
ness. We can be crazy for sense gratification, forced 
by lust and greed to act strangely and be captured by 
the senses and sense objects, or we can be addicted 
to the bhakti or the prema. If we pursue the lower 
realms  or  the  separated  energies  of  Krsna,  there 
are  consequences.  Pleasure  based  on  sense  grati-
fication only gives immediate gratification and later 
brings  negative  consequences.  For  this  reason,  we 
say that no pleasure exists in the material world. Of 
course,  sensual  stimulation  is  available  and  sense 
gratification  certainly  gives  stimulation,  but  it  is 
only  flickering.  If  every  seemingly  pleasant  sensa-
tion  immediately  results  in  punishment  and  chas-
tisement,  we  cannot  consider  the  sensation  to  be 
pleasurable. Engaging in the various types of sense

</span><br>
<span className="">12/26/02, 3:21 PM
</span><br>
<span className="">Wanting Only Devotional Service
</span><br>
<span className="">gratification  is  like  pressing  a  button  that  brings 
a  kind  of  suffering.  Therefore,  we  cannot  call  the 
sense  gratification  pleasurable.  Every  type  of  sin 
corresponds to a specific type of chastisement. It is 
unfortunate when a living entity continues to indulge 
in sin and gets repeatedly kicked. Often they think, “I 
got kicked because I did not make the right connec-
tion. I don’t have the right profession and therefore 
I am suffering. I should change professions. I don’t 
have the right body. I should be in a woman’s body 
instead  of  a  man’s  body  or  a  man’s  body  instead 
of a woman’s body. I just don’t live in the right part 
of the world. I made a mistake. She is just not the 
right  woman.  I  knew  I  shouldn’t  have  married  her. 
The  astrologer  told  me  so  and  Grandma  told  me 
also.”  Then  the  living  entity  tries  another  type  of 
connection.  After  trying  so  many  different  relation-
ships, someone may start to think, “Well, maybe I’m 
pursuing  the  wrong  gender  because  I  cannot  find 
satisfaction with the opposite sex. There is too much 
lack of understanding and lack of similarities.” Then, 
people pursue the same sex, and this also eventu-
ally  disturbs  them  so  they  again  look  for  another 
connection. In different parts of the world, bestiality 
or  sex  with  animals  is  on  the  rise.  Incest  is  also 
increasing. People know that pleasure exists some-
where,  but  feel  they  just  have  not  found  it  yet  and 
they are starving for it. Due to this starvation, they 
try  different  ways  to  experience  some  happiness. 
Many people who work five or six days a week simply 
wait  for  the  weekends  to  arrive.  After  the  weekend

<span className="">passes,  they  return  to  work  on  Monday  completely 
depressed,  because  they  spent  their  money  but 
somehow  did  not  experience  the  anticipated  plea-
sure. Sometimes, the college students cannot even 
wait for the weekend but party throughout the entire 
week.  Then,  when  final  exams  arrive,  they  have  to 
cram  and  experience  frustration.  Proper  happiness 
cannot exist outside of a connection with the atma 
or the soul.
</span><br>
<span className="">Redirecting Our Desires
</span><br>
<span className="">The  process  of  eliminating  unfavorable  desires 
emphasizes not wanting to pursue anything separate 
from Krsna. Our current environment challenges us 
because it constantly instructs us about our needs 
and wants. The environment incessantly stimulates 
us  to  accept  unnecessary  items  as  primary  needs 
or to accept unhealthy and devastating sense grati-
fication as beneficial. It will perpetually endeavor to 
agitate  the  senses  until  we  try  to  calm  the  senses 
by allowing them to enjoy the sense objects. Desire-
lessness  becomes  very  difficult  when  these  sinful 
desires  saturate  the  consciousness.  Our  condi-
tioning  may  cause  even  more  difficulty  if  the  intel-
ligence considers the fulfillment of these desires to 
be the ultimate goal of life. 
</span><br>
<span className="">It  becomes  very  challenging—but  not  impos-
sible.  If  we  continue  associating  with  stimuli  that 
condition  us  to  previous  responses,  we  will  simply 
increase  our  difficulty.  We  all  notice  that  once  we 
engage  in  devotional  service  in  a  serious  way,  we

</span><br>
<span className="">Wanting Only Devotional Service
</span><br>
<span className="">cannot  visit  the  same  places  in  the  same  way.  We 
cannot  associate  with  the  same  people.  If  we  feel 
comfortable with those who envy the Lord, we can 
understand  that  we  have  not  significantly  changed 
ourselves.  If  a  devotee  feels  too  comfortable  with 
people who are full of material desires, it means that 
the  devotee  also  possesses  too  many  of  the  same 
desires or at least the seeds of such desires. As we 
increasingly relinquish such desires, we will want to 
associate with environments that stimulate our level 
of  consciousness.  We  will  want  to  hear  about  the 
Lord,  visit  sacred  places  of  pilgrimage  and  remain 
in environments based on serving Krsna rather than 
serving the senses.
</span><br>
<span className="">Desires that Distract Us
</span><br>
<span className="">Desires  that  interfere  with  our  ability  to  relish 
the holy name and to experience Krsna’s unlimited 
compassion and love fall into four categories. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Liberation
</span><br>
<span className="">The  first  is  moksa  or  liberation.  What  is  wrong 
with  the  desire  for  liberation?  What  is  wrong  with 
desiring  liberation  from  sin?  The  problem  is  that 
this  desire  is  still  based  on  selfishness  rather  than 
on selfless service. It indicates a desire to be free of 
disturbances,  complications,  miseries  and  difficul-
ties. But what exists after these problems subside? 
What are the positive, eternal activities?
</span><br>
<span className="">Lust
</span><br>
<span className="">The next category is kama, or lust. What is wrong 
</span><br>

</span><br>
<span className="">123
</span><br>
<span className="">Reflections On Sacred Teachings, Volume One
</span><br>
<span className="">with lusting after another person? In this case, one 
no  longer  thinks  only  about  the  self,  because  the 
reflection  now  focuses  on  someone  else.  However, 
selfishness still permeates the consciousness since 
one thinks of the ways to enjoy the other person or 
connection. So what is wrong with mutual lust, where 
you  lust  after  someone  and  someone  lusts  after 
you?  Again  we  see  the  problem  of  selfish  interest 
that removes Krsna from the center. We accept lust 
as temporary and unsatisfying, yet some individuals 
may argue against this point. They may claim that an 
intelligent person would involve themselves in many 
areas  of  enjoyment  in  order  to  enjoy  everlasting 
pleasure. They feel that one partner or one type of 
sensual  reaction  is  not  sufficient.  Therefore,  if  one 
type of sense gratification becomes dull or dry, one 
simply  needs  to  change  the  involvement.  Unfortu-
nately, this type of mentality strongly  degrades  the 
consciousness. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Economic Development
</span><br>
<span className="">The third category is artha or desires for economic 
development. What is wrong with economic develop-
ment? When the materialists see the devotees, they 
may exclaim, “You people always want money! You 
build  so  many  temples,  travel  all  over  the  world 
and  buy  many  things!”  Yes,  we  use  money,  but 
consciousness  makes  the  difference.  The  material-
ists use money simply for their selfish gratification, 
but the devotees use the same money for spreading 
Krsna consciousness.

</span><br>
<span className="">Wanting Only Devotional Service
</span><br>
<span className="">Religiosity
</span><br>
<span className="">The final category is dharma or religiosity. What 
is wrong with religion? People may say, “You people 
oppose religion? This really sounds like a cult to me 
now!” Krsna says in the Bhagavad-gita 18.66: 
</span><br>
<span className=""> sarva-dharman parityajya
 mam ekam saranam vraja
 aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
 moksayisyami ma sucah
</span><br>
<span className="">“Abandon  all  varieties  of  religion 
and  just  surrender  unto  Me.  I  shall 
deliver you from all sinful reactions. 
Do not fear.”
</span><br>
<span className="">This may sound strange to a fruitive worker who 
only imagines calling on God in a time of need. Some 
people understand God to be merely on the shelf, in 
the shrine, in the temple, in the church, mosque or 
mandira.  In  this  way,  people  call  on  God  for  their 
needs, and after the needs have been fulfilled, they 
engage  in  their  regular  activities  until  the  wants 
arise again. Many of their prayers, meditations and 
reflections are based on literally giving orders to the 
Lord. Consequently, when a particular desire is not 
fulfilled, they turn into atheists.
</span><br>
<span className="">The Seed of Sinful Desires
</span><br>
<span className="">Our last topic of this sloka will focus on the seed 
of  sinful  desires  because  sometimes  we  stop  the

</span><br>
<span className="">sinful  activity  but  the  seed  for  sinful  activities  still 
remains.  Although  we  may  cut  off  the  top  of  the 
weed, if we leave the root in the ground it will grow 
again. What should we do? We first struggle to stop 
the sinful act but later find that this endeavor alone 
does not suffice. Maybe it seems that Krsna demands 
too much or that spiritual life is just too difficult. For 
example, the addict first stops the sinful activity, but 
due to previous conditioning and past tendencies, it 
may take a while before he or she can fully eradicate 
the  sinful  desires.  Without  sufficient  strong  faith, 
we  may  stop  the  sinful  activity  but  will  not  deeply 
or confidently want to fully separate ourselves from 
the sin. In other words, we may externally stop but 
we  continue  thinking  about  and  reflecting  on  past 
engagements.  As  another  example,  reflect  on  your 
transition  to  vegetarianism.  In  the  beginning,  you 
may have retained so much desire for smelling and 
eating  dead  bodies.  Now,  just  the  thought,  sight 
or  smell  of  dead  flesh  repulses  you.  In  this  case, 
we  stopped  the  action  with  realization  and  under-
standing  which  has  also  severed  the  seed  of  the 
desire.  Since  we  have  fully  accepted  the  action  as 
unhealthy,  we  have  few  desires  in  relation  to  this 
past  activity.  However,  if  we  stop  the  act  without 
firm conviction, then we merely repress the desire or 
put it on hold while the seed remains and the mind 
continues  to  associate  with  those  sinful  thoughts. 
This  position  can  be  very  precarious,  because  at 
some  point  the  mental  reflections  will  lead  to  the 
physical actions that can again dominate. This task

</span><br>
<span className="">of stopping the gross and then checking the subtle 
should not seem to be an impossible task. As long as 
we stop the gross sinful activity and then change our 
desires, gradually the weed will choke and suffocate 
from  lack  of  nourishment.  However,  if  we  continue 
providing  nourishment,  the  seed  will  continue  to 
cause us trouble.

</span><br>
<span className="">says:
</span><br>
<span className="">apuryamanam acala-pratistham
samudram apah pravisanti yadvat
tadvat kama yam pravisanti sarve
sa santim apnoti na kama-kami
</span><br>
<span className="">“A person who is not disturbed by 
the  incessant  flow  of  desires—that 
enter like rivers into the ocean, which 
is    ever  being  filled  but  is  always 
still—can  alone  achieve  peace,  and 
not  the  man  who  strives  to  satisfy 
such desires.”
</span><br>
<span className="">Srila Prabhupada writes in his purport: 
</span><br>
<span className="">“Although  the  vast  ocean  is  filled 
with  water,  it  is  always,  especially 
during  the  rainy  season,  being  filled 
with much more water. But the ocean 
remains  the  same—steady;  it  is  not 
agitated.”

<span className="">If we excessively tune in to the patterns of mate-
rial  society,  these  material  desires  will  naturally 
overload us, making it difficult not to act on them. 
They  will  demand  so  much.  The  devotee,  however, 
is  not  disturbed  by  such  desires.  The  next  verse, 
Bhagavad-gita 2.71, says:
</span><br>
<span className="">vihaya kaman yah sarvan
pumams carati nihsprhah
nirmamo nirahankarah
sa santim adhigacchati
</span><br>
<span className="">“A  person  who  has  given  up  all 
desires  for  sense  gratification,  who 
lives free from desires, who has given 
up all sense of proprietorship and is 
devoid  of  false  ego—he  alone  can 
attain real peace.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">The  presence  of  false  ego,  especially  the  pres-
ence  of  a  strong  false  ego,  will  automatically  draw 
numerous  material  desires  because  the  ego  will 
demand  unlimited  attention  and  gratification  that 
will bring many unhealthy desires. One last verse to 
reflect upon from Bhagavad-gita 6.24:
</span><br>
<span className="">sa niscayena yoktavyo
yogo ‘nirvinna-cetasa
sankalpa-prabhavan kamams
tyaktva sarvan asesatah

<span className="">manasaivendriya-gramam

</span><br>
<span className="">“One should engage oneself in the 
practice  of  yoga  with  determination 
and  faith  and  not  be  deviated  from 
the  path.  One  should  abandon, 
without  expectation,  all  material 
desires  born  of  mental  speculation 
and thus control all the senses on all 
sides by the mind.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">When the mind is not controlled and the senses 
are not regulated, it will be difficult to become free 
of  unhealthy  desires.  When  the  mind  is  absorbed 
in  transcendental  knowledge  and  the  senses  are 
subdued  or  regulated,  it  will  become  easier  to 
access higher desires.

<span className="">Questions &amp; Answers
Question: I do not quite understand this discussion 
of selfishness. It seems to me that Krsna conscious-
ness is the highest selfishness because we are after 
the highest thing. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: When we examine semantics and consider 
the  real  identity  of  the  self,  Krsna  consciousness 
is  the  real  activity  of  the  self.  This  process  is  not 
distinct from the ordinary self or connection of the 
self. For example, the hand is a natural part of the 
body  and  the  hand,  the  arm,  the  stomach  and  the

<span className="">mouth all go together. If the parts are in harmony, 
the  hand  takes  the  food  to  the  mouth,  the  mouth 
chews and the stomach digests to nourish the whole 
body.  However,  if  the  hand  decides  to  eat  without 
feeding  the  mouth  or  stomach,  the  body  will  not 
receive  any  nourishment.  We  understand  from 
Bhagavad-gita 15.7:
</span><br>
<span className="">mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhutah sanatanah
manah-sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
</span><br>
<span className="">in 
</span><br>
<span className="">“The 
</span><br>
<span className="">living 
</span><br>
<span className="">entities 
</span><br>
<span className="">this 
conditioned  world  are  My  eternal 
fragmental parts. Due to conditioned 
life,  they  are  struggling  very  hard 
with  the  six  senses,  which  include 
the mind.”
</span><br>
<span className="">We  are  all  eternally  and  originally  parts  and 
parcels  of  Krsna  but  are  now  suffering  in  various 
ways due to our desires separate from Krsna. If an 
object separates from its source, it either malfunc-
tions  or  becomes  totally  dysfunctional.  We  are 
undergoing a similar predicament due to our sepa-
ration  from  Krsna.  Once  the  connection  is  proper, 
the entire system will benefit. In one sense, you are 
right  because  this  prayer  says  that  we  do  not  want 
or  need  the  temporary.  Actually,  it  really  says  that

<span className="">Wanting Only Devotional Service
</span><br>
<span className="">we  do  not  want  anything  mediocre,  temporary  or 
secondary, but rather that we aspire for the highest. 
We  can  even  describe  Krsna  consciousness  as  the 
highest sense gratification because it gives the real 
satisfaction of the senses. We are literally preparing 
ourselves and arranging for the highest sense grati-
fication,  which  never  ends.  Although  we  need  to 
pay  some  small  dues  now,  our  present  endeavor 
to become fully Krsna conscious is worth the effort 
because in this lifetime we have a chance to close 
the  chapter  on  material  life  altogether.  We  have  a 
chance  to  end  all  of  our  suffering  and  all  of  our 
lamentation.  We  should  view  any  challenges,  tests 
or austerities we encounter as worth this price. The 
austerities  arise  as  we  inconvenience  ourselves  for 
the  preaching  mission;  our  goal  is  not  to  become 
yogis or tapasvis, but pure bhaktas.
</span><br>
<span className="">Austerities  may  occur  as  we  try  to  convert  the 
negative  energy  to  positive  energy  because  of  our 
conditioning  to  immediate  stimulation.  Negative 
activities  may  give  immediate  stimulation  that  we 
habitually  have  associated  with,  but  later  turn  into 
suffering. The higher taste, on the other hand, does 
not necessarily come so easily. At first, it even seems 
to present a type of imposition, struggle or anxiety 
and may even seem uninteresting, but if we continue 
the  pursuit,  it  will  ignite  the  higher  consciousness. 
In  society  today,  everything  happens  quickly  and 
mechanically and everyone wants the “quick fix.” We 
drive  to  a  restaurant,  place  an  order  and  immedi-
ately receive a bag full of food. We can go to another

<span className="">place, choose a car and receive it. One can change 
almost anything these days, including one’s physical 
appearance. If you dislike your body or face, simply 
change it. Plastic surgeons are making fortunes these 
days as more and more people want changes. They 
want  their  nose  higher,  their  lips  fuller  or  different 
breasts.  People  even  change  their  sex  these  days. 
These  constant  physical  changes  are  becoming  as 
commonplace as changing clothes. And after all of 
these procedures, they still do not realize that they 
are  not  their  bodies.  Instead  of  helping  them  to 
understand their identity as separate from the body, 
the  changes  actually  add  to  their  bodily  identifica-
tion. The accessibility of quick stimulation makes it 
difficult for people to think beyond immediate grati-
fication.  Consequently,  everything  revolves  around 
desire.  Now  we  have  supermarkets  with  thousands 
and  thousands  of  items.  You  can  simply  drive  to  a 
mall and spend all day shopping in a single building. 
Once you enter, you are completely bombarded with 
all types of advertisements that spark your desires. 
As  soon  as  you  enter  a  store,  they  immediately 
tell  you,  “Ah,  this  suit  is  just  for  you!  It  will  fit  you 
perfectly! It is just the right color and will bring out 
your natural beauty. It is exactly what you want!” In 
the next store, they tell you, “This stereo is just for 
you.  It  will  suit  your  needs  perfectly.”  On  the  way 
home from the mall, the billboards tell you, “Enjoy 
this product and it will fulfill your desires!” 
</span><br>
<span className="">Since  people  seek  pleasure  and  love,  and  tend 
to equate love with sex, practically every advertise-

<span className="">ment attempts to stimulate our sexual desires. While 
advertising a car or house, a half-naked person may 
stand next to the product, implying that one will lead 
to  the  other.  Usually,  the  person  and  the  product 
have  absolutely  nothing  to  do  with  each  other.  For 
example, a chewing gum ad may present a gorgeous 
model dressed in the finest clothes. She has spent 
hours to prepare for a short chewing gum advertise-
ment. The idea is that if you buy the chewing gum, 
you  will  enjoy  other  pleasures  as  well.  A  drink  ad 
may  show  the  Caribbean  with  beautiful  waterfalls 
and nice scenery, indicating that the drink will allow 
you  to  also  experience  this  environment  with  all 
types of sense gratification.
</span><br>
<span className="">As  Kali-yuga  increases  in  domination,  it  will 
become  concomitantly  harder  to  free  ourselves  of 
self-centered  desires.  It  becomes  very  formidable 
in the consciousness of the average person, and for 
this  reason,  we  should  very  carefully  avoid  playing 
into the norms of society. At the same time, we are 
not trying to cloister ourselves by living in the moun-
tains  or  in  caves,  nor  are  we  in  denial,  in  hiding 
or  ostracizing  ourselves.  The  Nectar  of  Devotion 
explains  that,  especially  in  the  beginning  stages, 
one should avoid certain environments that produce 
stimulation from the past. Later, when we sufficiently 
mature,  we  may  enter  many  environments  without 
being  affected.  Maya  has  many  funny  games.  She 
knows our weaknesses, and if we subject ourselves 
to  certain  situations,  she  will  capitalize  on  these 
weak  spots.  For  this  reason,  we  often  find  people

<span className="">who  suffer  from  mental  disturbances  attracted  to 
Krsna  consciousness.  Why?  Many  of  these  people 
are good candidates for devotional life because their 
mental disturbance has resulted from some tremen-
dous  disturbance  with  material  nature.  Usually  it 
comes from an attachment that later may spark the 
spirituality. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Someone  who  follows  the  sham  and  appears  to 
be  so-called  normal  in  this  insane  world  is  in  the 
greatest  difficulty.  It  is  wonderful  to  see  a  person 
bold  enough  to  be  different.  Even  materially,  the 
greatest  contributors  to  material  society  were  not 
afraid to be different and to act. If they had remained 
a part of the common scene, they never could have 
offered such achievements to society. We should not 
feel any intimidation in being different because one 
who  remains  too  attracted  to  the  material  energy 
will never become a serious devotee. As a matter of 
fact,  the  material  attachments  and  attractions  will 
be disqualifications.
</span><br>
<span className="">Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says: 
</span><br>
<span className="">“If  the  sadhaka’s  attachment  to 
sensual pleasure is not severed, then 
his  original  spiritual  identity  does 
not  become  manifest,  in  which  case 
bhakti, which is the intrinsic flavor of 
the Lord’s hladini potency, cannot be 
transformed  into  bhava,  or  amorous 
spiritual mellows.”

<span className="">If  we  continue  to  maintain  material  desires,  we 
may have to return to the material world or undergo 
repeated  experiences  in  order  to  fulfill  those 
desires, and this will prevent us from accessing our 
suddha-svarupa or actual form in our eternal home. 
We  should  see  our  many  aspirations  for  material 
enjoyment  as  a  curse,  because  the  Supersoul  will 
arrange certain experiences for their fulfillment that 
will  simply  distract  us.  We  can  continue  pursuing 
such desires for many lifetimes. Sometimes we see 
a person with a strong desire for fame. Even some 
devotees  strongly  desire  to  become  famous  musi-
cians,  but  the  desire  simply  revolves  around  their 
own interest in fame. They may come back for many, 
many lifetimes in search of that fame. Another person 
may desire the position of a very powerful adminis-
trator. They also will have to return life after life. For 
them, the position of the demigods may seem to be 
the highest, since they have the ability to lord over 
the material energy and act as big controllers. 
</span><br>
<span className="">We have to be sensitive about our types of desires 
and  honestly  examine  our  situation.  We  can  also 
place our case before the lotus feet of Radha-Damo-
dara and beg Them to take away our free will. This 
type  of  prayer  sounds  strange  to  the  materialists. 
In  Krsna  consciousness,  the  utmost  prayer  entails 
asking the Lord to take back our free will. Why? It 
is  the  abuse  and  constant  misuse  of  free  will  that 
has  kept  us  in  these  bodies  for  so  many  lifetimes. 
It  causes  us  to  cheat  ourselves,  to  struggle  with 
this  baggage  and  to  suffer  in  this  material  incar-

<span className="">ceration. Since Krsna fully loves us and His plan for 
us far surpasses any arrangements we could make 
for  ourselves,  if  we  simply  make  ourselves  Krsna’s 
slaves, we will begin to experience unlimited happi-
ness and satisfaction. Slavery is usually considered 
an unimaginable position, but this is a form of spiri-
tual craziness for the ultimate highest pleasure and 
satisfaction. It requires great faith to be able to fully 
put ourselves in that position and say, “Krsna, I am 
fully  Yours.”  Lord  Caitanya  makes  the  same  prayer 
later in the Siksastaka. When we fully rid ourselves 
of desires separate from Krsna and no longer want 
any  interferences  or  obstructions  to  surface  in  our 
consciousness, we will be able to say:
</span><br>
<span className="">“Dear  Lord,  I  know  what  I  want, 
but  You  know  what  I  need.  I  have 
many, many notions and desires for 
so  many  things  that  may  be  very 
unhealthy. I do not know all the sins 
I  have  committed  in  previous  lives 
or  all  the  complications  waiting  for 
me around the corner but You know. 
Therefore,  I  put  my  case  before  You 
today.  I  have  been  constantly  using 
this  free  will  to  make  the  wrong 
decisions  and  engage  in  the  wrong 
activities,  causing  me  to  miss  Your 
divine  compassion.  Today  I  ask  You 
to take back my free will.”

more curtains, no more dividers and no more sepa-
ration. It means pure oneness of desire.
</span><br>
<span className="">In  another  passage  in  the  Gitavali,  Srila  Bhakti-
</span><br>
<span className="">vinoda Thakura states: 
</span><br>
<span className="">“Oh  merciful  Lord,  this  is  my 
specific submission at Your lotus feet. 
I  do  not  ask  for  bodily  happiness, 
knowledge,  wealth  or  followers...Let 
I  presently 
whatever  attraction 
have  for  material  sense  enjoyment 
be  transformed  into  attraction  and 
affection  for  Your  lotus  feet.  I  pray 
not  only  that  this  affection  for  Your 
lotus  feet  remain  unvarying  in  all 
circumstances  of  happiness  and 
distress,  but  that  day  after  day  it 
continues to grow by the influence of 
chanting Your holy names. Wherever I 
take birth, be it in the animal species, 
in the heavenly planets or in hell, may 
ahaituki bhakti ever grace the heart of 
this servant, Bhaktivinoda.”
</span><br>
<span className="">Attraction between young boys and girls happens 
quite  spontaneously  and  one  does  not  have  to 
undergo  any  mental  or  physical  gymnastics  to 
develop attraction to someone. In the same way, one 
can pray for the day when one’s attraction and love 
for Krsna will occur as naturally and spontaneously

<span className="">as  this  attraction  for  mundane  love  and  pleasure. 
We will always be crazy, either materially or spiritu-
ally. We can either be captured, dragged, forced and 
beaten  by  kama,  lust,  that  pushes  us  and  coerces 
us into so many activities, or we can be surrounded, 
captured  and  immersed  in  the  prema  which  then 
aligns  us  with  many  wonderful  connections  with 
Krsna  and  His  wonderful  associates.  It  is  better  to 
be  different  in  an  insane  world  and  develop  our 
ultimate sanity, which involves craziness for Krsna’s 
love. We are proud of our different lifestyle because 
we  do  not  derive  happiness  from  our  residence  in 
the material world of limitations. We eagerly desire 
to become eternally free.

<span className="">The Ocean of Birth and Death
</span><br>
<span className="">this conclusion after analyzing the degree of harass-
ment caused by the body and the senses. Basically 
we can see that the body is a package. Sometimes 
people  critically  say,  “You  ‘Krsna  people’  are  very 
gloomy  and  do  not  appreciate  the  beautiful  body.” 
We appreciate beauty, but we do not view a tempo-
rary  body  that  always  harasses  us  and  ultimately 
ends in devastation as real beauty. Regardless of our 
achievements  or  the  type  of  care  we  render  to  our 
bodies, the end result is always the same. Whether 
we  are  wealthy,  famous,  tall,  short,  thin,  fat,  male, 
female  or  of  a  certain  race,  death  will  inevitably 
come in the end. In some countries, the average life 
span is as short as 42 years. In other countries, the 
average  may  be  54  to  75.  In  America,  the  average 
reaches  75  or  78.  If  we  live  the  average  life  span, 
whether it is 40, 50 or 70 years, we can understand 
that  the  time  is  very  short.  As  we  look  at  our  own 
lives, most of us are 35, 45 or 55 and a few younger 
or older. In most cases, if we live a normal life span, 
half  of  our  lives  have  already  passed  with  only  a 
few more years remaining. When the body reaches 
termination, it will be burned to ashes or put into the 
ground to be eaten by the worms. In some cultures, 
the body ends up on a mountain to be eaten by the 
birds.  Other  cultures  simply  throw  the  body  into  a 
river. In all of these situations, the end is similar and 
the body is finished. So, we do not derive excessive 
excitement  from  the  body,  considering  that  ulti-
mately it maintains for a period of time, deteriorates 
and  then  finishes.  We  look  beyond  the  temporary 
and beyond the quickly approaching termination.

<span className="">Beyond the Body
</span><br>
<span className="">Beyond the body, of course, is the atma or soul. 
As we examine the body, which we ultimately must 
leave when it fails us, we realize that we picked it up 
at some point. This leads us to question the origin of 
the body and also its destination. In between these 
points, we must also inquire about the nature of our 
experience,  our  duties  and  the  real  position  of  the 
soul. Here Lord Caitanya speaks out, “My position is 
that I am Your eternal servitor.” Caitanya Mahaprabhu 
speaks  in  the  mood  of  a  devotee.  “Even  though  I 
am eternally Yours, even though we have an eternal 
connection, and even though our situation involves 
an  eternal  bond  of  love  and  devotion,  somehow  I 
have fallen.” The soul, of course, is sac-cid-ananda 
vigraha, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality. “Yet 
somehow, I have fallen.” Not only have I fallen, but 
also I have fallen into an ocean—a deep situation of 
birth and death. Then He pleads, “Please pick me up 
from this ocean of death and situate Me as an atom 
at Your lotus feet.”
</span><br>
<span className="">People  always  endeavor  to  find  some  happiness 
or  pleasure.  In  this  regard,  Prabhupada  gives  the 
simple example of a fish out of water. A fish cannot 
be happy until it returns to its natural habitat. 
</span><br>
<span className="">The Material Prison
</span><br>
<span className="">Srila  Bhaktivinoda  Thakura  also  gives  us  a  few 
points. He says, “O Lord Krsna, O son of Nanda Maha-
raja, I am Your eternal servant, but as a result of my 
previous activities I have now fallen into this terrible

<span className="">The Ocean of Birth and Death
</span><br>
<span className="">ocean  of  material  existence”  (Sri  Siksastaka,  47). 
For  example,  a  criminal  who  commits  a  serious 
crime gets thrown into prison and perhaps even into 
solitary confinement. Due to the crime, the individual 
receives  chastisement,  supposedly  for  rectification, 
but mainly he or she undergoes chastisement. Then 
one laments over their wretched situation and even 
pleads for release. The person acted improperly and 
now must serve a sentence. Although there may be 
a change of consciousness and an early parole, one 
must pay the necessary dues as a result of the sinful 
activity.  Originally,  the  prison  system  was  meant 
to  provide  a  place  for  deviant  or  sinful  people  to 
contemplate  their  crimes  in  order  to  change  their 
lifestyle  and  pursue  a  humanistic  and  spiritual 
connection.  Today,  the  system  is  almost  the  oppo-
site of this ideal. In some cases, a prisoner involved 
in a petty crime may come out rehabilitated and not 
get involved in lawbreaking again. However, in many 
cases,  because  the  environment  contains  such  a 
dismal mood filled with anger, frustration and great 
intensity, it will literally pollute the people and make 
them worse. Many criminals may leave with a more 
expert analysis or understanding of how to commit 
greater crimes. 
</span><br>
<span className="">The current penal system basically makes crimi-
nals hard-hearted, since it focuses more on chastise-
ment than on rehabilitation. Rehabilitation involves 
atonement or prayascitta which means recognizing 
the crime and engaging in an activity to help remove 
the  karma.  It  is  not  just  a  matter  of  chastisement.

</span><br>
<span className="">In  our  Vaisnava  philosophy,  we  first  chastise  and 
then forgive. When one performs an improper action 
without  receiving  chastisement,  it  leads  to  several 
consequences.  First  of  all,  one  will  not  remove 
the  karma  connected  with  the  crime  or  deviation. 
Secondly,  there  will  not  be  any  deterrent.  Lastly,  it 
will not send a message to the community that such 
activities are unacceptable. Gradually, the individual 
will increasingly engage in the deviation until other 
members of the community take on the same type 
of  mentality.  Unless  there  is  the  rule  of  law  and 
some  repercussion  for  those  who  do  not  follow, 
the  improper  mindsets  and  actions  will  increase. 
Some of the problems with the legal system develop 
because,  when  somebody  commits  a  crime,  their 
chastisement often depends on the skill and finesse 
of the lawyer. Sometimes the penalty even depends 
on  the  part  of  the  world,  one’s  connections  with 
certain people, or the amount of money offered for 
a  bribe.  When  the  rule  of  law  is  properly  honored, 
there is quicker attention to rewarding proper activi-
ties and giving the necessary chastisement.
</span><br>
<span className="">The current prisons are big money making busi-
nesses, comparable to most enterprises connected 
with  sin.  In  this  regard,  there  are  interesting  and 
phenomenal  facts  about  America.  Over  8  million 
people are held in penal institutions throughout the 
world and more than half of these are in the United 
States, China and Russia. The United States prison 
population rate is 680 per 100,000  of the  national 
population.  When  a  country  needs  to  incarcerate

<span className="">so  many  of  its  citizens  in  order  to  prevent  societal 
disturbances,  this  is  an  indication  of  other  serious 
problems.  The  incoherence  will  be  found  either  in 
the citizens, the leaders or both because the crimi-
nals are products of the environment. According to a 
report by the Bureau of Justice, the maintenance of 
one prisoner typically ranges from 20,000 to 30,000 
dollars a year. This is not a bad salary. The majority 
of prisoners would not earn this much money if they 
lived and worked outside, but they go to prison and 
this  amount  is  required  for  their  sustenance  each 
year. From these facts, we can see that prisons are a 
big money making business. So many criminals are 
never apprehended, and if they do end up in prison, 
they  may  not  mind  because  they  simply  have  to 
spend a few years in a plush prison while the money 
waits  for  them  on  the  outside.  Unfortunately,  it 
would seem that crime pays and this will cause more 
crime, along with an increase in criminal mentality. 
In  some  countries,  if  you  have  enough  money,  you 
can  bribe  your  way  out  of  almost  any  crime,  even 
murder. 
</span><br>
<span className="">We  are  all  prisoners  and  actually  imprison 
ourselves  to  different  degrees  by  our  addictions  to 
sense gratification that beat us and keep us bound 
and chained. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura describes 
this  material  existence  as  a  dreadful  ocean  that 
people fall in to due to their misdeeds. Lord Caitanya 
similarly explains this position of imprisonment. He 
speaks for everyone in relation to our wretched situa-
tion. Srila Bhaktivinoda compares lust (kama), anger

<span className="">(krodha), envy (matsara), and other contaminations 
to crocodiles who wait with ferocious mouths simply 
to  swallow  us  up.  Now,  just  visualize  this  imagery. 
One  is  thrown  into  an  ocean  of  death  and  then 
harassed in a life-threatening situation by ferocious 
crocodiles of anger, envy, lust, etc. The living entity 
has  fallen  into  a  devastating  and  life-threatening 
situation.  Maya  just  waits  like  these  crocodiles. 
She simply waits for you to lose your balance or fail 
to  notice  her  presence  so  that  she  can  attack  you. 
Maya is always waiting and always attentive, looking 
for an opportunity to capture us and take advantage 
of  our  weak  points.  Wherever  one  is  weak,  maya 
will attack in that area. Therefore, we want to look 
at  and  recognize  our  own  weaknesses  in  order  to 
eradicate them or to at least better protect our devo-
tional  creepers  and  ourselves.  We  need  to  deeply 
consider how to improve the quality and quantity of 
our service and how to make a serious transforma-
tion of consciousness. If we anticipate and prepare 
for an attack, when it finally comes, we will not be 
as devastated.
</span><br>
<span className="">Waves in the Ocean of Birth and Death
</span><br>
<span className="">Srila  Bhaktivinoda  Thakura  continues  to  explain 
that we are drifting here and there in the waves of 
wasted  hopes  and  misplaced  anxieties.  He  gives 
such  amazing  descriptions  of  the  waves  in  this 
terrible ocean of birth and death, which come to us 
in  this  dangerous  and  incarcerated  situation.  They 
are  hopes  but  only  wicked  hopes  that  beat  us  up.

</span><br>
<span className="">People have all types of aspirations for unnecessary 
and  improper  things.  Then  Bhaktivinoda  Thakura 
says, “Lashing gales of bad association add further 
suffering.”  The  devastating  wind  comes  and  goes 
and  the  waves  smack  us  around.  He  refers  to  the 
wind  as  bad  or  improper  association  that  engulfs 
us  and  causes  greater  anxiety.  In  such  a  condition 
he says, “Factually, I can see that there is no hope 
for  shelter  except  Your  unlimited  mercy.”  Now  he 
pleads,  “Occasionally  a  small  bunch  of  weeds  can 
be  seen  floatingthese  are  the  weeds  of  karma, 
jnana,  yoga,  austerity,  etc.  But  has  anyone  ever 
crossed  the  mighty  ocean  of  nescience  with  the 
help  of  such  paltry  flotsam.”  He  sees  these  straws 
as simply an illusion of security, because the straws 
themselves are at the mercy of the wind, waves and 
currents.  People  seek  refuge  in  such  fallible  shel-
ters  such  as  demigod  worship,  but  these  will  not 
help anyone cross over the ocean of material exis-
tence or remove us from this devastating situation. 
Instead, we will simply pull the straw down with us 
as  we  drown.  “The  sturdy  boat  of  Your  holy  name 
is  the  only  means  of  crossing  over  this  dangerous 
ocean  of  material  existence.  Considering  all  these 
facts  with  a  level  head,  I  begged  for  the  invincible 
boat  of  Your  holy  name  from  my  guru,  which  he 
gave me by his causeless mercy. O Lord, You are the 
renowned protector of Your devotees, who are souls 
surrendered  to  Your  lotus  feet.  Therefore  please 
accept  this  homeless  destitute,  cleanse  me  of  all 
faults, and consider me as a particle of dust at Your

the ocean with all of this confusion and harassment 
and they scream out and plead for a boat to come 
and save them.
</span><br>
<span className="">Our Need to Serve
</span><br>
<span className="">This position of servitude is essential to the soul. 
We  constantly  serve  our  senses  rather  than  atten-
tively serving the senses of Krsna. We worship false 
or  unnecessary  things  that  have  no  ability  to  give 
us security or protection. I had an experience once 
here in America while preaching in Cleveland where 
my mother lived. I visited my mother for a few days 
and  my  family  arranged  a  program  with  people 
coming  from  all  over  the  city.  One  day,  the  televi-
sion  in  the  other  room  showed  Michael  Jackson 
performing. I noticed the program and it completely 
amazed  me.  People  were  literally  fainting,  falling 
down, screaming, crying and pulling their hair out. 
There were thousands and thousands of people and 
every  few  minutes,  paramedics  would  pick  people 
up  off  the  floor,  put  them  on  a  stretcher  and  take 
them  to  the  ambulance.  It  was  amazing.  I  became 
hypnotized for a short time with the amazing reflec-
tion that people naturally want to have someone to 
worship.  When  we  do  not  have  a  genuine  spiritual 
connection, there is a great void and hunger for some-
thing or someone in which to channel that affection 
and  concern.  And  this  was  intense  worship.  Many 
members of the audience dressed like him, and in 
their  homes  they  probably  have  his  pictures  every-

</span><br>
<span className="">The Ocean of Birth and Death
</span><br>
<span className="">where  and  learn  extensive  information  about  him. 
They try to act like him and memorize all the words 
of his songs. This is comparable to a perverted form 
of  deity  worship.  They  have  pictures  everywhere, 
constantly hear about him, talk about him with their 
friends and discuss their Michael Jackson lila. Some 
people try to follow each of his performances. This 
is like a devotee’s pilgrimage to sacred places. It was 
just astounding, like demigod worship. 
</span><br>
<span className="">If  entities  could  have  more  direct  contact  with 
the  demigods,  they  would  see  that  they  are  very 
powerful  and  are  even  in  charge  of  universes. 
If  these  mundane  examples  are  so  intense,  just 
imagine the intensity of Krsna’s arrival on the scene. 
Everyone must be overwhelmed as He strolls in very 
suave and cool. Or they see Him prepare for chival-
rous activity, throwing His chadar over his shoulder 
before  engaging  in  combat.  People  must  be  filled 
with amazement and awe, thinking, “O, did you see 
what  Krsna  did?  Amazing!”  These  mundane  exam-
ples can only provide a small indication of what the 
living entity is missing by suffering in this ocean of 
misery  and  trying  to  gain  flickering  pleasures.  As 
Michael  Jackson  sang,  the  people  sang  along  and 
literally experienced some tamo-guna ecstasy. This 
is not bhava or prema in a spiritual sense, but some 
affection  and  attraction  exist  along  with  apprecia-
tion and intense worship. I remember when he once 
came to Washington; he had more security than the 
president. With all of the vehicles, it seemed almost 
like an army.

<span className="">Our  prison  is  not  a  very  high  level  prison,  so 
different entities that come into these scenes from 
higher  prisons  will  be  impressive  because  of  their 
sakti.  If  such  personalities  could  bring  people  to 
Krsna, it would be powerful because, as Bhagavad-
gita 3.21 says:
</span><br>
<span className="">yad yad acarati sresthas
tat tad evetaro janah
sa yat pramanam kurute
lokas tad anuvartate

follow. 
performs,  common  men 
And  whatever  standards  he  sets 
by  exemplary  acts,  all  the  world 
pursues.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">Unfortunately, the opposite occurs because many 
of these types of personalities sing degrading songs 
simply meant to narcotize the people who constantly 
repeat their mantras. Lord Caitanya emphasizes the 
chanting of the holy name, which is liberating. The 
opposite  is  known  as  gramya-katha  or  unneces-
sary use of the tongue, which incarcerates the living 
entity  that  much  more.  We  also  see  in  so  many 
places an increase in gangs. It is not just teenagers 
but sometimes it is mature adults also. Why would a 
mature adult enter a gang? As the society becomes 
cultureless due to Kali-yuga, people become devoid 
of  friendship  and  higher  aspirations.  They  lack

<span className="">goals  and  have  no  higher  purpose  because  they 
believe in nothing and nobody believes in them. As 
a result, they become even more lost in this ocean 
of  misery  and  consequently  substitute  the  idea  of 
community, unity and fraternity. They substitute that 
which genuinely exists as a part of the living entity 
in his relationship and service to Krsna with artificial 
arrangements.  Gangs  usually  have  strict  codes  of 
ethics.  The  mafia,  for  example,  has  strict  codes  of 
bonding and protecting each other. When they meet, 
they embrace each other, kiss one another and will 
even  die  for  each  other.  When  there  are  miscon-
ceptions  about  the  goal  of  life,  about  giving  one’s 
dedication to sadhu, guru and Krsna, one’s dedica-
tion will have to go somewhere else. The dedication 
usually goes into these situations that devastate and 
prevent spiritual knowledge and life.
</span><br>
<span className="">Finding the Highest Service
</span><br>
<span className="">The  position  of  servitude  and  worship  exists 
within  everyone.  Srila  Prabhupada  tells  a  story 
about a village man who endeavored to make a deep 
connection  in  his  service.  First  he  saw  the  mayor 
and  decided  to  serve  him  considering  his  position 
important. However, he soon noticed that the mayor 
gave  tax  money  and  homage  to  the  tax  collectors 
who came on behalf of the Governor. He then went 
to serve the Governor. He constantly looked for the 
best  service  connection  and  the  greatest  person 
to  serve.  While  serving  the  Governor,  he  noticed  a 
group  of  men  who  arrived  on  horseback  to  collect

<span className="">revenue  or  viceroy  for  the  King.  He  then  went  to 
serve the King. While serving the King, he noticed a 
sage who came and gave advice to the King about 
ruling  his  kingdom.  One  day,  he  approached  the 
sage,  “Are  you  the  greatest  person  to  serve?”  The 
sage explained about someone greater than himself, 
and advised him to go to the temple and serve their 
most worshipable Lord Narayana if he wanted to find 
the greatest person to serve. The village gentleman 
was  serious  and  sincere.  He  asked  the  right  ques-
tions  and,  after  receiving  appropriate  guidance,  he 
readily  acted  on  the  instructions.  He  immediately 
went to the temple of Lord Narayana, but he arrived 
late and the temple was closed. He tried to enter, but 
since the doors were locked, he slept in front of the 
temple. In the morning, several brahmanas arrived 
and  saw  the  village  man  with  the  Deity’s  chadar 
covering him. They became furious, thinking, “Who 
is this rogue who came into the temple and took the 
Deity’s cloth to use for himself?” But, when they tried 
to open the doors, they found them to be closed and 
locked. Since they locked the doors the night before 
and found the doors still locked in the morning, they 
understood  that  he  could  not  have  entered.  The 
Deity greatly appreciated and reciprocated with this 
simple,  but  sincere  and  serious  village  man,  who 
understood the value of service and deeply endeav-
ored  to  find  the  greatest  person  to  serve.  He  then 
remained at the temple and became a pujari.
</span><br>
<span className="">The  living  entity  should  always  ask  such  ques-
tions.  Why  am  I  in  this  miserable  state?  How  did  I

<span className="">get here and how can I get out? What is necessary? 
After  finding  what  is  necessary,  one  should  very 
eagerly  act  upon  it.  Unfortunately,  people  are  so 
distracted that it becomes hard for them to engage 
in  deep  introspection.  Maya  plays  so  many  games 
and makes it hard for people to even think because 
of the constant bombardment. The mind is so funny. 
Sometimes we begin to look at our past and think 
that,  as  devotees,  we  have  missed  something.  We 
have been chanting Hare Krsna for years, engaging 
in services, and we think, “Look at my school friend, 
my  old  buddy,  girlfriend  or  my  old  acquaintance. 
They are doing this and that, and if I had not been a 
devotee, I could have put fifteen or twenty years into 
another engagement.” Sometimes we even think, “I 
have wasted so much time.” If our ultimate goal was 
to  excel  in  material  life,  then  we  definitely  wasted 
our time by involving ourselves in devotional service. 
However,  if  we  genuinely  want  to  pursue  spiritual 
life, then there is no question of waste. If we eagerly 
want to serve maya, then we definitely wasted time. 
We missed many, many years of intense service to 
maya. The mind plays funny games because, when 
we  reflect  back  to  so-called  pleasurable  activities 
in the past, the mind only remembers the flickering 
pleasure  associated  with  the  sense  gratification. 
The  mind  does  not  simultaneously  remind  you  of 
all  the  misery  and  suffering  associated  with  the 
insignificant  sense  pleasure.  We  should  view  these 
memories  as  ghosts  trying  to  haunt  us,  because 
when someone allows these distorted memories to

<span className="">remain  in  the  consciousness,  the  mind  will  unfor-
tunately  try  to  return  to  past  habits  and  even  act 
on  them.  It  is  very  unfortunate.  When  Prabhupada 
gave sannyasa, he explained the devastating effect 
of  becoming  envious  of  the  materialists.  One  may 
think,  “Look  at  me!  I  just  sleep  in  my  little  room 
with a small mat, but look at those people! I bet they 
sleep  in  a  nice  bed  and  have  a  beautiful  car.  Just 
look at my car. It always breaks down, forcing me to 
wait on the side of the road while people continue 
passing me. What am I doing?” In this way, we begin 
to envy the materialists. Someone else may think, “I 
just sing little bhajanas but I could be like Michael 
Jackson  or  another  great  star.  People  would  be  in 
awe  as  I  walk  onto  the  stage.”  This  envy  is  very 
dangerous because we will begin to want to engage 
in the activities of the materialists at the expense of 
our devotional life. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Begging for Mercy
</span><br>
<span className="">This next passage comes from The Beggar One, 
my book of short meditations. It is in the mood of 
begging for Krsna’s mercy and looking at the living 
entity’s wretched situation. I would like to share one 
of these meditations because this topic, knowledge 
of the identity of the soul, is rather simple but also 
quite  complex.  This  meditation  is  called,  “Your 
Success is our Freedom.” This meditation is written 
as  a  discussion  between  the  senses,  body,  mind, 
intelligence and the soul. The senses do their thing, 
the  mind  does  its  thing  and  the  intelligence  does

</span><br>
<span className="">The Ocean of Birth and Death
</span><br>
<span className="">something  else.  Sometimes  we  have  difficulty  in 
seeing all the different aspects of this package. For 
example,  sometimes  we  try  to  read  and  the  mind 
would  like  to  absorb  itself  in  the  subject  matter. 
However, while trying to focus, the body feels tired. 
The mind and intelligence want to absorb themselves 
in the subject matter but the body says, “No.” Then 
you  try  again  to  read  and  really  want  to  continue 
with  your  area  of  exploration.  You  want  to  reach 
the  next  chapter,  but  the  next  thing  you  know,  the 
book ends up on the floor along with the body. The 
body  says  it  is  tired  but  the  mind  and  intelligence 
feel differently. After awhile, we may actually have to 
let the body rest and the mind and intelligence will 
finally  agree.  As  another  example,  imagine  one  of 
your most embarrassing situations. Your intelligence 
would like to forget the entire incident and pretend 
that  it  never  happened,  but  the  mind  continues  to 
remind you of the past. You relive the embarrassing 
event in your mind each time the memory returns. 
This short meditation particularly gives more atten-
tion  to  the  distinctness  of  the  soul  but  simultane-
ously  deals  with  the  whole  package.  The  soul  has 
to  deal  with  the  house  or  body  that  it  uses  which 
includes  the  mind  and  intelligence.  At  this  point, 
the  soul  has  a  bad  deal  because  of  the  package  it 
must carry around for a period of time. The following 
meditation  is  a  conversation  between  the  soul  and 
the entire package.

<span className="">and spoke to me in a very sweet and 
loving  voice.  My  dear  brother,  we 
who were one are now acting as two 
separate entities.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">When we go back to Godhead, all of this mahat-
tattva will no longer interfere and the atma, or soul, 
will  expand  into  the  actual  body  associated  with 
Krsna. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“I  have  been  accompanying  you 
for 
</span><br>
<span className="">in  different  material  bodies 
thousands of lifetimes.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">In  many  cases,  the  soul  remains  incarcerated 
in bodies for hundreds and thousands of lifetimes, 
trying different types of prison environments based 
on previous patterns. 
</span><br>
<span className="">to 
</span><br>
<span className="">“Each  time  I  am  sentenced  to 
another  body,  my  desires  to  return 
home 
the  Kingdom  of  God 
increases.  I  thought  the  last  body  I 
was in would be the final one. There 
were unfortunately some distractions, 
which have brought me back again.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">For  example,  sometimes  a  criminal  becomes 
an  ideal  prisoner  and  plans  for  parole.  Then  he 
may  suddenly  have  a  fight  or  break  another  rule, 
and  find  himself  back  in  a  cell.  He  thinks  he  will

<span className="">gain his freedom, but soon finds a locked door and 
different  bars  staring  him  in  the  face.  Prabhupada 
explains in the Srimad-Bhagavatam that when the 
soul enters the womb again, the entity gains aware-
ness  of  hundreds  of  lifetimes  of  experiences.  The 
living entity then feels miserable and thinks, “Oh no, 
not again. I am in this situation and I have to take 
another body again!” The entity has that awareness 
and material life continues. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“My  dear  beloved  brother,  we  are 
connected  by  much  more  than  you 
can  presently  realize.  Our  destinies 
are  interlocked,  although  I  watch 
you  everyday  just  as  the  Supersoul 
watches us both. I am most disturbed 
when I witness you doing things that 
keep  us  away  from  the  association 
of  the  Divine  Couple.  This  does  not 
in any way take away from my love 
for  you,  but  it  is  my  love  of  you 
that  causes  me  to  experience  such 
disturbances.  This  material  world 
is  an  empty,  lonely,  morbid  prison, 
which pales in comparison to our real 
home. No one there is a stranger.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">This  refers  to  the  material  world  as  a  prison 
because  the  soul’s  real  home  is  in  the  spiritual 
kingdom.  This  emphasizes  the  nature  of  the  mate-
rial world, which involves so many enemies, terrible

<span className="">relationships,  attacks  and  assaults.  In  the  spiritual 
world, no one is a stranger. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“On  the  contrary,  there  is  an 
ongoing  love  affair  between  every 
living being.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">We feel so lonely and constantly look for love but 
</span><br>
<span className="">can never quite find it. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“Every day we have the most loving 
and  intoxicating  exchanges  with  the 
Supreme. When one of us gets special 
affection from the Lord or His Divine 
Consort,  we  all  experience  the  same 
joy simultaneously. But here in these 
material  hells,  the  living  entities  are 
extremely  self-centered,  exploitive, 
offensive and misguided.”
</span><br>
<span className="">The  Siksastaka  verse  describes  matsara  or 
</span><br>
<span className="">extreme enviousness of each other. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“My beloved brother, I cannot bear 
another  lifetime  away  from  spiritual 
associates.  At  home,  they  are  aware 
of  my  desperate  efforts  to  return  to 
them.”
</span><br>
<span className="">Imagine  the  soul,  the  real  us,  suffering  in  this 
ocean of misery with constant attacks from croco-

</span><br>
<span className="">diles,  the  wind,  improper  desires,  bad  association, 
etc. We want out of this prison and our ultimate asso-
ciates  in  the  spiritual  kingdom  have  much  greater 
love and concern for us than we can imagine. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“Their  love  for  me  is  so  much 
greater  than  my  love  for  them,  just 
as my love for you is far greater than 
your  understanding  and  love  for 
me.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">The soul is speaking to its mind, intelligence and 
</span><br>
<span className="">body. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“Above  my  own  desires  to  return 
home,  I  do  not  want  to  cause  any 
well  wishing  residents  at  home  any 
disturbance.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">For  example,  as  we  have  previously  said,  if  a 
drunken  person  comes  to  the  temple,  they  would 
speak out or enter in obnoxious ways and be unable 
to follow the proper etiquette in the temple environ-
ment. Similarly, in our contaminated state, with all 
of  our  improper  desires,  sinful  activities  and  even 
mixed  devotional  activities,  we  would  simply  be  a 
disturbance  in  the  spiritual  kingdom.  Such  imper-
fection cannot enter the spiritual environment. The 
drunken person can enter the temple and have the 
opportunity  to  become  fortunate  considering  the 
availability  of  everything,  but  they  would  not  be

</span><br>
<span className="">able  to  take  advantage  due  to  their  current  situ-
ation.  Here,  the  soul  understands  its  position  in 
having to deal with its package. Similarly, a drunken 
person  who  understands  some  of  the  etiquette  in 
the temple environment will realize that they cannot 
come in and cause any disturbance. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“Nor  do  I  want  you  to  remain 
a  part  of  this  miserable  world  of 
limitations.”
</span><br>
<span className="">The  soul  cannot  return  to  the  spiritual  kingdom 
because of the craziness in the mind, the body and 
the  senses.  For  instance,  if  you  become  a  good 
devotee and have a drunkard as a friend, you may 
want to come into the temple but cannot visit with 
your friend. It would not be proper to bring him into 
such an atmosphere. However, the friendship locks 
the two of you together and, as a result, you do not 
come to the temple because of his association. The 
soul is in this position.
</span><br>
<span className="">“Therefore,  I  have  become  more 
active in your consciousness to help 
guide  you  to  self-realization.  After 
all,  your  success  is  freedom  for  us 
both. My dear beloved brother, there 
are some areas you need to work at 
seriously to guarantee our freedom.”
</span><br>
<span className="">The  soul  has  higher  knowledge,  but  has  to  deal

</span><br>
<span className="">with  the  present  situation  until  the  mind  and  intel-
ligence change and restrict the senses. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“You  must  become  more  selfless 
and  you  must  allow  your  natural 
love for the Godhead to fully flourish. 
I  then  replied,  ‘For  so  many  years  I 
have  been  trying  to  be  selfless,  but 
still I am far from the goal.’” 
</span><br>
<span className="">Now the mind and intelligence are responding to 
</span><br>
<span className="">the soul and the soul is answering.
</span><br>
<span className="">“My  soul  exclaimed,  ‘Those  who 
think  the  Supreme  Lord  is  far  away 
will never attain Him, but those who 
understand that He is ever-accessible 
and  monitoring  all  activities,  will 
attain Him in the near future.’” 
</span><br>
<span className="">The mind and intelligence explain their previous 
endeavors  to  become  serious,  dedicated  and  self-
less  but  feel  the  task  to  be  impossible.  The  soul 
replies that, if one thinks that God is far away, it will 
be  an  impossible  task  and  one  will  not  be  able  to 
attain Him. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“By  the  mercy  of  the  Lord,  you 
have  been  given  a  guru,  so  your 
selflessness  is  simply  a  matter  of 
serving your guru with more love and

<span className="">care. Give up all of your individualized 
desires  and  live  for  his  pleasure,  as 
he lived and lives for you.”
</span><br>
<span className="">Just  as  Srila  Prabhupada  lived  and  lives  for  his 
disciples, give up your individual desires and live for 
his pleasure. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“My  beloved,  as 
</span><br>
<span className="">far  as  your 
loving  the  Lord,  this  is  your  natural 
condition.  So  free  yourself  from  all 
remaining  ignorance,  doubts,  fears 
and  enviousness.  You  have  been 
given  everything  that  you  need  to 
uncover that natural love.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">As  long  as  the  mind  and  intelligence  continue 
with  their  “stuff,”  the  soul  will  remain  imprisoned. 
The soul is pleading with the lower self to abandon 
the improper activities. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“So  why  not  today  fall  into  the 
Lord’s  loving  embrace?  His  arms 
have been extended, waiting for us to 
return. Speed up, beloved. Hold on to 
me tighter as we run our last lap back 
to  the  Divine  Couple  in  Their  realm 
of  pure  love.  These  last  tests  and 
challenges  will  be  most  difficult,  but 
together we will soon be successful.

<span className="">Let  us  not  keep  our  Lovers  waiting 
any 
longer.  My  beloved  brother, 
always  try  to  remember  that  you 
have many helpers cheering you on. 
Your  success  is  freedom  for  both  of 
us. I will personally help you at every 
step. I love you, for your body is our 
means of escape.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">I included this meditation to add to the mood of 
the discussion regarding the living entity’s incarcer-
ated  state.  As  Bhaktivinoda  Thakura  has  empha-
sized, the entity is in this terrible ocean of suffering, 
filled  with  bad  association,  lust,  envy  and  greed, 
which  keeps  the  entity  completely  entangled.  A 
strong  boat  in  the  form  of  the  holy  name  is  avail-
able for the living entity to cross over the ocean of 
material suffering. We also consider the importance 
of  having  sufficient  dedication,  taking  shelter  of  a 
guru,  and  engaging  in  proper  activity  with  sadhu. 
Then, the difficult ocean, which is normally a formi-
dable  obstacle,  can  be  crossed  over  by  the  proper 
captain.  In  these  prayers,  Lord  Caitanya  presents 
the  mood  of  the  perfect  devotee  who  cries  out, 
analyzes, evaluates, focuses and pleads for Krsna’s 
love and association. Although He is Krsna Himself, 
He shows us the proper spirit to have as a devotee.

<span className="">freedom. However, the Christians pray to Jesus, the 
object  of  their  reverence.  Since  Jesus  promises  to 
send them to the spiritual kingdom, what planet do 
they attain?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  Jesus  emphasizes  the  accessibility  of 
heaven and those who genuinely connect with him 
can  reach  the  heavenly  kingdom.  Devotees  of  the 
Lord enter into all types of environments, including 
hells and heavens. When the living entities move into 
different  environments,  they  still  have  chances  to 
connect with actual devotees of Krsna and to receive 
guidance if they so desire. Often, certain teachers, 
saints  or  prophets  play  a  role  in  the  master  plan. 
Prophet  Muhammad  also  played  such  a  role.  They 
gave basic, fundamental teachings, but people have 
trouble with even these basics. However, if genuine 
followers properly adhere to such teachers, they can 
connect with the results offered by these teachers. 
This will help them advance to a higher level that will 
prepare them to make a transcendental connection. 
A pious person is a greater candidate to receive tran-
scendental knowledge.

<span className="">Question: In relation to the mind, you mentioned that 
certain thoughts enter and remain in the conscious-
ness,  causing  one  to  reflect  on  previous  activities 
and  even  stimulate  past  desires.  What  process 
would you offer or suggest on a practical day-to-day 
basis to clear the mind of such thoughts?

<span className="">The Ocean of Birth and Death
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  First  I  mentioned  that  the  mind  tricks  us 
with  memories  of  pleasurable  sensations  but  fails 
to  show  the  negativity  or  pain  associated  with  the 
temporary  pleasures.  Most  importantly,  we  must 
realize  that  every  sinful  activity  or  sense  gratifica-
tion that we involve ourselves in comes with a corre-
sponding  chastisement.  Prabhupada  emphasizes 
that  there  is  no  happiness  in  the  material  world. 
Sometimes  this  statement  bewilders  people.  They 
argue, “When I take intoxication, I feel some stimu-
lation. When I have illicit sex, I feel this stimulation.” 
But  we  cannot  really  call  an  activity  pleasurable  if 
it  constantly  results  in  an  experience  of  chastise-
ment.  If  a  button  exists  which  gives  a  pleasurable 
sensation,  but  then  produces  a  type  of  suffering 
after  pressing  it,  the  pleasure  is  simply  a  façade. 
We  will  simply  undergo  many  miserable  situations. 
We also have to look at that connection. When the 
mind starts taking us back, we have to use the intel-
ligence and connect with the soul in order to think, 
“No!  This  will  result  in  serious  consequences.  I  do 
not want to be in such miserable conditions again, 
lifetime after lifetime.”
</span><br>
<span className="">We  can  stop  the  sinful  reflections  in  the  mind 
when  a  genuine,  higher  taste  begins  to  develop. 
However,  this  is  not  so  easy,  because  before  the 
higher  taste  develops,  we  will  have  to  undergo  a 
transitional stage without the lower or higher tastes. 
We first stop the lower engagements but the higher 
activities and reflections may not be well grounded 
or  established  in  our  consciousness.  If  one  lacks

</span><br>
<span className="">sufficient  strength,  faith  and  encouraging  associa-
tion, one will return to the previous stimulation. We 
constantly  see  devotees  who  return  to  previous 
patterns  because  they  seek  some  stimulation  or 
pleasure  and  have  not  yet  experienced  it  in  devo-
tional  service.  The  first  problem  is  that  they  are 
not  following  the  science  properly;  therefore,  they 
are  not  getting  sufficient  results.  Second,  they  are 
conditioned to immediate gratification. Sense gratifi-
cation happens in this way. It gives some immediate 
reciprocation but later it brings misery. Spiritual life 
seems  to  be  an  inconvenience  at  first  because  it 
requires  reconditioning,  but  later  it  will  bring  great 
happiness.  In  the  interim,  especially  if  our  service 
is filled with too many aparadhas, the prescription 
will not give the full benefit. If the person does not 
stop the aparadhas, after a while they will return to 
their  old  patterns.  If  you  keep  running  into  a  wall, 
you  have  two  choices.  You  can  either  finally  jump 
over  it  or  continue  bumping  into  the  wall  over  and 
over again. After hitting the wall enough times, you 
may  finally  decide  that  the  pursuit  is  worthless.  Or 
else  you  may  begin  to  think  that  nothing  is  on  the 
other side and therefore return to previous patterns 
and situations. In a devotee’s life, if he or she fails to 
eventually make progress and continues to run into 
the  same  obstacles  without  moving  beyond  them, 
at  some  point  they  will  turn  back.  When  the  mind 
begins to revert to old patterns, we have to drag it 
forward by taming it or by absorbing it in spiritually 
stimulating engagements.

<span className="">The Ocean of Birth and Death
</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  If  a  devotee  has  a  hard  time  moving 
beyond  certain  anarthas,  what  can  help  them  to 
move  beyond  these  obstacles?  All  devotees  have 
anarthas  but  how  do  we  come  together  and  help 
each  other  jump  over  the  wall  instead  of  running 
into it?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  Each  devotee  has  a  duty  to  help  remind 
others about the goals. It is not always pleasant to 
remind  each  other,  especially  if  we  are  not  ready 
to  accept  that  something  is  wrong  with  us.  If  we 
sincerely  accept  our  weaknesses,  when  someone 
reminds us of them, we actually feel happy because 
we  have  a  chance  to  improve  in  that  area.  In  Srila 
Prabhupada’s example of the village gentleman, the 
man wanted to discover the best service connection. 
As  soon  as  one  situation  revealed  a  higher  point 
of  service,  he  eagerly  followed  because  his  heart 
was  genuine.  Consequently,  he  was  able  to  serve 
Krsna. If we are really genuine, we will enthusiasti-
cally  receive  help  and  discover  the  areas  we  need 
work on. We will realize, “Krsna is so kind that He is 
helping me understand the things that separate me 
from experiencing His love.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">If  you  have  a  sickness  but  cannot  discover  the 
specific problem, it will be difficult to find the proper 
prescription. Sometimes people have an illness and 
they are full of anxiety because, after visiting many 
doctors and even holistic practitioners, they cannot 
discover the exact nature of their problem. This lack 
of  knowledge  can  devastate  one  even  more  than

</span><br>
<span className="">knowing  their  type  of  illness,  because  one  cannot 
even  begin  to  remedy  the  situation  or  look  for  a 
prescription. So, we really want to thank those who 
remind  us  of  our  anarthas.  Then  the  question  is, 
“Why  do  they  have  to  speak  so  harshly?  Couldn’t 
they  do  it  more  tactfully?  They  could  say,  ‘My  dear 
wonderful,  beautiful  and  most  exalted  devotee. 
Please  let  me  take  this  most  merciful  chance  to 
let  you  know  that  I  am  your  servant,  your  eternal 
servant.  I  want  you  to  know  that,  as  your  servant, 
I think that you are in a little maya.’” However, the 
help comes in different ways. Krsna’s love may come 
in  an  embrace  or  sometimes  His  love  seemingly 
manifests  as  a  kick.  We  should  be  eager  to  use, 
learn  and  grow  from  any  situation,  thanking  Krsna 
and guru for the help to look closer at ourselves. 
</span><br>
<span className="">When I was a brahmacari on the traveling party, 
I  would  sometimes  ask  my  associates  to  tell  me 
what  I  do  improperly,  what  I  do  that  bothers  them 
and how to improve. I would keep a little notebook 
and always write things down since my mind is dull. 
Whatever they would tell me, I would write it down. 
The responses would vary. At times, a person would 
make  the  harshest  comments  and  the  mind  would 
say, “It’s not me, it’s you! You have that problem even 
more than me.” Since I knew that the mind is crazy, 
I would just write down whatever they told me and 
close the book. Maybe two days later, I would open 
the book again and take it very seriously. I consid-
ered that I had these associations for a reason and 
there are no accidents. And, even if another person

<span className="">The Ocean of Birth and Death
</span><br>
<span className="">and  I  seemingly  could  not  get  along,  I  would  still 
ask  and  take  their  comments  even  more  seriously. 
I  would  genuinely  try  to  work  on  their  comments. 
If somebody said, “You chant too loud, you eat too 
much or you sleep too much,” I would write it down 
and  change  because  it  interfered  with  the  other 
person’s  service.  I  would  also  consider  that,  since 
we  have  to  associate  together,  I  want  to  do  more 
service  and  encourage  someone  else  to  do  more 
service  in  order  to  offer  more  service  to  the  spiri-
tual master. If we really want to grow, every situation 
can  provide  an  opportunity  for  growth.  We  should 
try this technique on a practical level. We can speak 
with  those  in  our  environments  and  ask  for  advice 
on how to improve in our devotional life and service. 
We  should  take  their  advice  seriously  and  not  just 
ask  in  a  sentimental  or  mechanical  way.  Someone 
may  say,  “I  think  you  should  be  more  competent, 
more  clean,  less  agitated,  less  aggressive  or  listen 
more  instead  of  reacting.”  We  should  take  it  seri-
ously.  Someone  else  may  enthusiastically  give  an 
entire list and we should accept it, appreciating that 
our godbrother, godsister or devotee is taking time 
to help us become better servants.

<span className="">Many of our devotees in Washington will ask each 
other these questions from time to time. It is a diffi-
cult process because you do not ask only your good 
friend, but you ask many different devotees for ideas 
on  how  to  become  a  better  servant.  You  can  ask 
them, “What do I do that is distracting and a both-
eration? It will help me to understand how to better

<span className="">serve  the  Vaisnavas  and  the  guru.”  Then,  write  it 
down because ultimately, if someone is honest, the 
words may not be pleasing to the mind. We all have 
so many faults or we would not be in this situation. 
If we did not have any faults, we would not have to 
carry  around  all  this  baggage.  Since  we  have  so 
many faults, we want to be attentive in order to put 
them behind us and to unlock the shackles of these 
imprisoned states. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  Does  maya  help  us  run  faster  by  chas-
tising us?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  This  relates  to  the  question,  “Why  does 
Krsna  allow  maya?”  Krsna  and  the  devotees  who 
work on behalf of the Lord are calling us home. We 
are in a very dangerous situation.  Maya also helps 
us move toward Krsna. She presents different offers 
and then gives the consequences. At some point, the 
intelligent person begins to think, “What is going on? 
Let me stop all of this nonsense. Let me change my 
position, consciousness and habits in order to move 
out of this hellish situation.” Maya works for Krsna. 
Srila  Bhaktisiddhanta  Sarasvati  Thakura  explains 
that, although maya seems to be against us, she is 
really for us. Maya constantly presents different tests 
to see if we are ready to return home—if we pass the 
test, we can become certified. Maya will test us in 
so many ways and, if we are not really ready, she will 
simply distract us and show us our lack of readiness. 
In this sense, maya is wonderful, but we obviously

<span className="">do  not  want  to  fall  into  her  clutches.  When  we  no 
longer fall prey to maya or give in to her, it indicates 
that we are ready for Krsna. Somebody cannot come 
into  the  temple  drunk  because  they  will  cause  all 
kinds  of  problems.  If  we  have  a  security  guard  at 
the  temple  door,  they  will  carefully  scrutinize  the 
drunkard if he returns a second time. The guard will 
carefully evaluate his position in order to see if he is 
proper. If he is proper, then he may enter. The guard 
will test him because of his past record of deviation. 
He  will  need  to  prove  that  he  has  abandoned  his 
deviant behavior. We have been deviant for so many 
lifetimes  and  intoxicated  by  many  illusions;  conse-
quently, maya carefully watches us. If we pass the 
test, then maya will say, “Okay, you can enter.”

<span className="">Flowing Tears of Love
</span><br>
<span className="">The  sixth  sloka  of  the  Sri  Siksastaka  deals 
primarily with the way in which we experience good 
fortune as we come closer to the Lord. 
</span><br>

constantly  when  I  chant  Your  holy

and  when  will  the  hairs  of  my  body 
stand on end at the recitation of Your 
name?”
</span><br>
<span className="">These  powerful  offerings  by  Lord  Caitanya 
constantly draw us back to the scriptures. Here we 
examine  Lord  Caitanya  in  the  mood  of  a  perfect 
devotee who shows by example how to attain Him. It 
is especially significant that Lord Caitanya has deliv-

<span className="">ered  the  knowledge  Himself.  Sometimes  a  person 
has good intentions, but does not have the ability to 
follow through. At other times, people simply create a 
façade with no intention of following through. Krsna 
presents  the  complete  science  of  how  to  return  to 
Godhead,  and  as  Lord  Caitanya,  he  demonstrates 
the  process  personally.  He  has  the  ability  to  carry 
out whatever he presents, because all things come 
from Him and are under His control.
</span><br>
<span className="">Lord Caitanya is Krsna Himself who comes as the 
perfect devotee and gives a complete understanding 
of  the  process  required  to  reach  Him.  It  does  not 
lack anything or involve sentimentality because He 
is fully able to deliver according to His promise. The 
Nectar  of  Devotion  elaborates  on  bhava,  which  is 
the early stage of prema. This sloka, which reflects 
bhava and the initial stages of prema is right in line. 
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura explains that spiritual life 
begins with sincere faith followed by sadhu-sanga. 
In  their  association,  we  begin  to  practice  the  nine-
fold  path  of  bhakti,  namely  sravanam,  kirtanam, 
smaranam,  pada-sevanam,  arcanam,  vandanam, 
dasyam,  sakhyam  and  atma-nivedanam.  As  a 
result  of  these  engagements,  one  begins  to  attain 
certain  levels  of  unfoldment.  The  Nectar  of  Devo-
tion  shows  how  we  progress  to  the  stages  of  ruci, 
attachment, and finally bhava.

<span className="">the spiritual world or the activities of our real home 
with  the  perceptions  and  mindsets  of  the  material 
world. We need to understand that the activities in 
the spiritual world are the reality and everything else 
is  only  a  perverted  reflection.  It  would  be  strange 
to try to use the perverted reflection to understand 
the reality. We will come up with all kinds of strange 
conceptions.  We  can  take  this  reflection  one  step 
further, realizing that every action or thought in its 
natural  state  is  all  meant  for  Krsna.  For  example, 
someone may dance, sing or cook, but every activity 
is actually meant for Krsna in the real sense. In the 
material  world,  all  of  these  activities  occur  outside 
of their natural connection. Singing in the material 
world  has  no  deep  meaning.  Real  singing  means 
singing  for  the  glorification  of  Krsna.  Dancing, 
playing  musical  instruments  or  dressing  nicely  is 
really meant for Krsna. Dressing without dressing for 
Krsna is just an activity that occurs in this ocean of 
material suffering in the imprisoned state.
</span><br>
<span className="">Unnatural Conditioning
</span><br>
<span className="">Strange  things  occur  in  prison  since  it  is  a  very 
unnatural  place  and  just  a  strange  replica  of  the 
reality. The prison facility is a city and culture of its 
own.  In  prison,  cigarettes  gain  the  value  of  money 
and many patterns arise that mimic the patterns of 
society. Power becomes the rule of law and people 
surrender  to  different  types  of  situations  based  on 
that  environment.  Death  and  violence  may  mean 
very  little  to  them.  One  prisoner  can  beat,  stab

</span><br>
<span className="">or  even  kill  another  without  feeling  any  compunc-
tion. Although human activities continue in  prison, 
they  become  perverted  and  strange.  Aristotle  and 
Plato expressed this idea in their writings, using the 
example  of  beings  that  live  in  a  cave.  In  our  own 
philosophy,  we  find  the  example  of  the  frog  in  the 
well. If someone tries to see or analyze a situation 
from a limited perspective, like a frog that has spent 
his  entire  life  in  the  confines  of  a  small  well,  their 
analysis will simply result in confusion. The activities 
of the separated, material world are confusing, and 
always  full  of  miseries  because  they  do  not  give  a 
real connection.
</span><br>
<span className="">Reflections of the Spiritual World
</span><br>
<span className="">When  we  hear  pastimes  from  Krsna  Book  or 
hear  about  the  symptoms  of  bhava  such  as  anub-
hava,  vyabhicaribhava  and  sthayibhava,  which 
involve one’s hair standing on end, crying, dancing 
or  hiccupping,  we  can  appreciate  that  anything 
done in the consciousness of pleasing Krsna is the 
real  thing.  Otherwise,  things  that  happen  within 
the  confinement  of  the  material  body  and  material 
world are only perverted reflections of spiritual activ-
ities. Dancing exists in the spiritual world, but here 
people disco dance and belly dance. Dressing exists 
there, but here people put on all different types of 
costumes and decorate their dying external bodies. 
Spiritual life is not so farfetched—it is the real thing 
done in the real way. The Lord and His pure repre-
sentatives  view  our  obsession  with  our  material 
shackles with great concern.

</span><br>
<span className="">This  underscores  how  the  impersonalists  and 
voidists are so far off, although they consider their 
engagements  to  be  spiritual.  The  voidists  think 
that spiritual life is a negation of what we normally 
perceive with our limited, perverted physical vision. 
The impersonalists think that spiritual life is void of 
heterogeneity, variety, interactions and relationships. 
Even worse are the sahajiyas, who think that their 
“spiritual”  practices  can  be  done  in  the  conscious-
ness  of  lust.  Srila  Prabhupada  warned  us  about 
these categories. He warned us about gross involve-
ment  in  material  life,  which  is  a  total  disqualifica-
tion  for  spiritual  acceleration.  He  warned  us  about 
the voidists and to an even greater extent about the 
impersonalists.  However,  he  warned  us  the  most 
about the sahajiyas. If we look closely, we see how 
Srila  Prabhupada  spoke  about  the  impersonalists 
but he stressed the dangers of sahajiya philosophy 
even  more.  That  which  seems  so  close  but  is  not 
the actual reality can bewilder us even more. When 
someone makes counterfeit money very expertly, or 
has  cut  glass  that  closely  resembles  a  diamond,  it 
will cause confusion. We need the proper vision in 
order to properly see. If one looks through glasses or 
instruments that have not been “tinged with the salve 
of love,” and the eyes have not been opened through 
the process of guru and sastra, the distorted vision 
will  simply  lead  to  a  disturbance.  That  which  does 
not coincide with the revealed scriptures will cause 
serious disturbances.

</span><br>
<span className="">Symptoms of Love
</span><br>
<span className="">These Sri Siksastaka prayers have infinite depth 
to  explore.  This  verse  focuses  on  the  external 
expressions of bhava. The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 
1.3.25-26  describes  the  nine  symptoms  or  anub-
havas that manifest in the stage of bhava. We will 
look  deeper  at  what  these  nine  symptoms  entail 
and what level of consciousness allows us to experi-
ence such symptoms, which grade into prema. The 
first  symptom,  ksanti  means  that,  although  a  call 
for  agitation  may  be  present,  the  devotee’s  heart 
remains undisturbed. Avyartha kalatva, the second 
symptom, means that a devotee does not waste time 
in  activities  unrelated  to  the  cultivation  of  bhakti. 
We  understand  that  kala  or  time  itself  is  a  part  of 
the  mahatattva.  In  time,  everything  material  dete-
riorates  and  ultimately  reaches  devastation.  If  we 
look  at  the  conception  of  time  through  the  vision 
of the material world, it seems strange. However, if 
we see everything in relation to Krsna’s service, we 
understand  that  Krsna  always  was  and  always  will 
be. This gives us a different perspective on time alto-
gether. In the material world, time basically refers to 
a material object’s period of duration, its deteriora-
tion  and  its  ultimate  devastation—normally  relative 
to  a  living  entity’s  particular  body.  Something  may 
have  a  longer  life  span  and  something  may  have  a 
shorter  life  span,  but  the  body  only  has  so  much 
longevity.  How  do  we  understand  an  environment 
where  nothing  dies  and  nothing  deteriorates?  It  is 
not so easy to comprehend based on normal percep-

</span><br>
<span className="">tion, but we can understand the existence of inter-
vals and experiences.
</span><br>
<span className="">When Will it Happen?
</span><br>
<span className="">These Siksastaka prayers teach lessons for prac-
tical application and we should try to apply them to 
our own lives. Lord Caitanya emphasizes the possi-
bilities such as tears of love. When will it happen? It 
is  accessible.  When  will  it  happen?  When  will  they 
overflow  constantly  when  I  chant  Your  holy  name? 
When  will  it  happen?  When  will  my  voice  choke 
up?  When  will  the  hairs  of  my  body  stand  on  end 
at the recitation of Your name? It will happen when 
the  anarthas  and  all  of  the  previously  described 
obstacles  are  removed  and  when  anyabhilasa, 
or  desires  separate  from  Krsna,  no  longer  remain 
in  the  heart.  Instead,  anyabhilasita  sunyam,  no 
desires separate from Krsna’s desires, will remain. It 
does not mean that we are desireless, because only 
dead matter has no desires. Rather, it means having 
desires related to Krsna’s desires. Persons who have 
attained  bhava  want  to  use  all  of  their  time  for 
Krsna and for the cultivation of bhakti. This mindful-
ness will manifest according to the maturity of our 
consciousness. A neophyte devotee will have many 
activities and desires not associated with devotional 
service.  For  example,  a  new  bhakta  or  bhaktin 
will  have  many  attachments  and  desires,  and  they 
may  still  feel  comfortable  around  people  who  are 
not very spiritual. As one waters and nourishes the 
creeper, it will grow and mature and want even more

</span><br>
<span className="">12/26/02, 3:21 PM
</span><br>
<span className="">Flowing Tears of Love
</span><br>
<span className="">nourishment.  For  example,  if  we  usually  eat  good 
cooking  but  later  receive  badly  prepared  food,  we 
will  have  little  taste  for  it  since  we  have  previously 
appreciated nourishing prasadam or foodstuffs. So, 
one who relishes the bhakti cannot find pleasure in 
hearing  or  associating  with  the  mundane.  Hearing 
discussions  about  mundane  topics  will  sound  like 
noise,  and  mundane  activities  will  seem  ghostly. 
Again,  if  we  feel  too  comfortable  in  such  environ-
ments, we can understand that the development of 
bhakti  and  bhava  is  far  from  being  established  in 
our consciousness.
</span><br>
<span className="">The third symptom of bhava is virakti, or detach-
ment  from  the  objects  of  sense  enjoyment.  This  is 
almost  self-explanatory.  If  we  focus  our  energy  in 
lower  pursuits,  we  will  not  have  sufficient  energy 
left for the higher engagements. As we detach from 
the  gratification  of  our  own  senses,  we  will  attach 
ourselves  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  senses  of  the 
Lord,  which  concomitantly  gives  nourishment  to 
the soul. The fourth symptom is mana sunyata, or 
pridelessness.  When  we  have  too  much  pride  and 
consider  ourselves  to  be  of  great  importance,  we 
cannot have deep appreciation of the Lord. 
</span><br>
<span className="">The  fifth  symptom  is  asa  bandha.  In  one  of  his 
prayers,  Srila  Rupa  Gosvami  describes  this  quality 
when  he  says  that  he  has  hope  against  hope  of 
somehow  receiving  the  mercy  of  Krsna  although 
he is very unqualified. This prayer is very powerful. 
He  feels  unqualified  and  unworthy  of  Krsna’s  great 
boons,  benedictions,  blessings,  compassion  and

</span><br>
<span className="">179

<span className="">Reflections On Sacred Teachings, Volume One
</span><br>
<span className="">love.  Although  he  sees  himself  as  unworthy,  he 
believes the Lord’s mercy to be greater than His law. 
He understands that the mercy is ultimately neces-
sary and is everyone’s birthright. Therefore, although 
he feels unworthy, he does not remove himself from 
standing in the line and waiting for the opportunity 
to receive such blessings. He refuses to lose focus, 
step out of line and miss the opportunity, although 
he  does  not  feel  worthy  of  such  a  benediction.  He 
remains very determined and fixed, knowing what is 
available for those who stay in the line. He explains 
the  situation  in  this  way.  He  has  firm  hope  of 
obtaining  Bhagavan,  Krsna.  The  sixth  symptom  of 
bhava is utkantha, or intense longing for the Lord. 
The seventh is nama gane sada ruci, ever relishing 
a  strong  taste  to  chant  the  holy  name.  The  eighth 
attribute  is  asaktis  tad  gunakhyane,  attachment 
for hearing and chanting the qualities of Krsna. The 
last one is pritis tad vasati sthale, love for the place 
of Krsna’s pastimes. From these nine symptoms of 
bhava, The Nectar of Devotion discusses the many 
different subdivisions of bhava and then prema.
</span><br>
<span className="">Recognizing Authentic Devotion
</span><br>
<span className="">There  is  one  interesting  story  of  Srila  Bhaktisid-
dhanta  Sarasvati  Thakura  and  several  of  his  disci-
ples.  The  disciples  wanted  their  spiritual  master  to 
meet  this  Rama  bhakta  who  was  a  very  famous 
devotee and always seemed to be in ecstasy. People 
would come from distant places in order to have his 
association.  He  always  lamented  living  in  his  body

</span><br>
<span className="">Flowing Tears of Love
</span><br>
<span className="">while  experiencing  separation  from  his  worshipful 
Lord  Rama.  One  day,  he  felt  such  intense  separa-
tion that he wanted to eliminate his physical body, 
considering  that  the  material  body  imprisons  the 
soul  in  the  material  realm.  With  this  intention,  he 
literally  dove  in  front  of  a  train  in  order  to  commit 
suicide. He could no longer tolerate the separation, 
and although the train ran over his legs, he continued 
to chant, “Rama! Rama! Rama! Rama!” So, the disci-
ples of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura had 
good  feelings  about  this  person  and  wanted  their 
spiritual  master  to  meet  him.  They  deeply  appreci-
ated their own spiritual master and eagerly desired 
the meeting of these great personalities. When Srila 
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura met the bhakta, 
he  simply  inquired,  “Is  your  relationship  with  Lord 
Rama  direct  or  indirect?”  The  devotee  explained 
that he felt great anxiety due to his separation from 
Lord  Rama.  He  had  so  much  love  for  his  Lord  and 
was definitely experiencing a direct relationship. 
</span><br>
<span className="">The  suddha  bhaktas  never  display  such  arro-
gance. The acarya could understand that this Rama 
bhakta was experiencing ecstasy or shadow ecstasy 
but not pure prema. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati 
Thakura looked over at his disciples and said, “Let’s 
go.” They then left because what Lord Caitanya has 
given  far  surpasses  bhukti,  mukti,  and  siddhi.  It 
goes  far  beyond  even  the  initial  levels  of  ecstasy 
and far beyond shadow ecstasy. Shadow ecstasy can 
manifest in two different ways. One way occurs when 
someone  is  in  touch  with  a  very  powerful  devotee

<span className="">of the Lord, a pure devotee on the platform of pure-
ness,  suddha  bhakti,  and  the  devotion  carried  by 
such  a  great  soul  spills  over  simply  through  their 
association.  Those  in  the  association  of  such  a 
devotee  will  feel  very  stimulating  absorption  and 
even  ecstasy.  A  devotee  named  Sudama,  who  was 
Srila  Prabhupada’s  personal  servant  for  a  period 
of  time  and  also  president  of  the  temple  in  Hawaii 
among a few other temples, spoke about some very 
wonderful experiences with Srila Prabhupada on one 
of the Prabhupada Memory videotapes. One time in 
Hawaii,  they  went  to  see  Srila  Prabhupada  in  his 
room  and  he  was  crying  like  anything.  Tears  were 
shooting from his eyes as he spoke about Krsna. The 
devotees  asked  Srila  Prabhupada  if  something  was 
wrong  and  Prabhupada  started  to  explain  that  his 
spiritual  master  is  so  kind.  Then  the  few  devotees 
who came in the room also started to cry. Sudama 
said the room was totally surcharged with Prabhupa-
da’s  intense  absorption,  reflection  and  meditation. 
This  happened  a  couple  of  times.  Normally,  Srila 
Prabhupada  did  not  display  his  sentiment  or  deep 
feelings. 
</span><br>
<span className="">There  were  times  when  he  chanted  the  Jaya 
Radha-Madhava prayers, and looked at the Deities, 
and his bodily color would change and tears would 
shoot out of his eyes. During the period before he left 
the planet, and especially in the last month, there was 
very little checking of his emotions. Someone would 
mention a cow and Prabhupada would start crying. 
Simple  things  would  set  off  intense  expressions  of

Krsna, but we see everything as separate from Krsna. 
When such great devotees come to preach, they tone 
themselves down in order to relate to the craziness 
of  the  material  world.  As  Srila  Prabhupada  thought 
of  Krsna’s  pastimes  on  the  planet,  whatever  was 
said,  done  or  read  would  often  ignite  such  expres-
sions. In this situation in Hawaii, the devotees were 
very new. Sudama had only been a devotee for one 
or two years and did not fully understand the situa-
tion.  They  simply  came  in  to  this  surcharged  room 
and found Srila Prabhupada in a sort of trance with 
tears in his eyes. This is one expression of shadow 
ecstasy.  Sometimes  Krsna  will  give  a  new  person, 
who initially joins the movement, a type of unusual 
taste  or  experience.  In  Narada  Muni’s  case,  Krsna 
appeared  before  him  personally,  but  told  him  that 
he would not see Him again until his next lifetime. 
He wanted Narada to continue striving for that which 
was available and to stay in line in order to receive. 
Our  acaryas,  including  our  great  grandfather  Srila 
Bhaktisiddhanta  Sarasvati  Thakura,  were  in  levels 
of  absorption  far  beyond  any  mysticism  or  shadow 
ecstasy.  This  Rama  bhakta  was  always  chanting 
Rama and was experiencing something beyond the 
ordinary,  but  considering  Srila  Bhaktisiddhanta’s 
position as a resident of the spiritual world and fully 
in tune with Krsna’s service, such expressions were 
unimpressive. The Nectar of Devotion also explains 
that,  as  long  as  one  desires  fame,  material  facility, 
subtle  mystical  facility  or  other  material  pleasures,

<span className="">one will never be able to become steady in devotion. 
We  can  even  approach  the  initial  stages  of  bhava 
only  to  slide  down  if  we  do  not  remain  fixed  in 
unmotivated, uninterrupted devotion. As long as we 
maintain desires separate from Krsna’s desires, the 
improper desires will become cancerous, grow and 
create  all  types  of  infections  that  ultimately  bring 
devastation.
</span><br>
<span className="">Where is Krsna Prema?
</span><br>
<span className="">I would like to include another passage from my 
book  The  Beggar  One  entitled  “Where  is  Krsna 
Prema?” Prema is available and is waiting for us but 
we frequently put it on hold. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“Please forgive me. I have no time. 
I’m in a terrific hurry. I’m looking for 
Krsna  Prema.  I  have  waited  lifetimes 
to meet Him. If you like, you can look 
with me. I have heard He is in town.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">Love of God is around and accessible. When we 
hear  about  it,  we  should  be  very  uneasy  and  very 
eager to try to see how to receive and connect with 
it.  We  should  be  ready  to  align  with  any  person  or 
situation  conducive  to  its  development.  Simultane-
ously, we should want to run away from anything that 
is not bona fide, not proper, or that causes interfer-
ence. Any situation or association that does not help 
to establish prema bhakti is a disturbance.

<span className="">“Please forgive me. I have no time. 
I’m  in  a  terrific  hurry.  Krsna  Prema 
will  be  here  soon.  Everything  is  so 
untidy. I must see that everything is 
in  order  to  receive  Him.  If  you  like, 
you can help me.”
</span><br>
<span className="">When we expect a guest, maybe a good friend or 
an important person, we want everything to be nice 
and  tidy.  We  might  even  call  some  people  to  help 
us  prepare  and  remain  focused  before  the  guests 
arrive. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“Please forgive me. I have no time. 
I’m  in  a  terrific  hurry.  I  overslept. 
Today I have an appointment to meet 
Krsna  Prema.  He  is  very  hard  to  see. 
Finally I met one of His agents, who 
arranged a meeting for me.”
</span><br>
<span className="">We  cannot  reach  these  goals  without  a  connec-
tion with Krsna’s representatives. Even in some very 
powerful  secular  organizations,  we  cannot  simply 
join.  For  instance,  in  certain  secret  societies,  you 
can  only  join  if  a  member  feels  that  your  qualities 
will add to the mood of their activities and commit-
ments. No one returns to the spiritual world without 
the assistance of, or a connection with, a resident of 
the spiritual world. There is no question.

<span className="">I’m  in  a  terrific  hurry.  If  I  stop  to 
socialize, I may miss my only chance 
to  associate  with  Krsna  Prema.  You 
know  He  is  quite  demanding  and 
always on time.”
</span><br>
<span className="">We  can  get  distracted  and  detoured  in  so  many 
ways. We need to socialize but any serious connec-
tion  that  hinders  our  progression  towards  the  ulti-
mate goal simply wastes time. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“Please forgive me. I have no time. 
I’m  in  a  terrific  hurry.  I  do  not  have 
time  to  eat  or  sleep.  Even  if  I  had 
time,  I  have  no  desire,  as  today  or 
tomorrow I will be meeting with Krsna 
Prema.  Please  forgive  me.  I  have  no 
time.  I’m  in  a  terrific  hurry.  I  do  not 
want to be an inconvenience, but can 
you  kindly  share  with  me  your  own 
experiences  with  Krsna  Prema?  I  will 
be meeting with Him very soon.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">A  devotee  should  always  strive  for  higher  asso-
ciation.  We  should  not  just  associate  only  with  our 
peers,  but  should  always  try  to  hear  from  connec-
tions  that  inspire  us,  pull  us  up,  remind  us  of  the 
goal and encourage us.

to  everyone.  Some  say  He  is  the 
perfect  Master,  some  say  He  is  the 
sweetest child, still others see Him as 
the perfect loving companion. I hope 
to meet with Him very soon. I will tell 
you  my  own  perception  when  that 
glorious day comes.”
</span><br>
<span className="">Once we return to the spiritual kingdom or fully 
understand  our  original  relationship  with  the  Lord, 
we  will  know  and  serve  Him  through  a  particular 
rasa.

<span className="">“Yes, it is true; I’m in a terrific hurry. 
I have been so lonely for so long, but 
very soon I will join with Krsna Prema. 
The  wise  say  His  association  takes 
away all loneliness. Yes, my friend, it 
is true; I’m in a terrific hurry. For all 
of  my  life  I  have  been  searching  for 
a deep relationship that is not based 
on a material foundation. Those who 
are wise say that a relationship with 
Krsna Prema is the most profound.”

<span className="">People  constantly  look  for  connections  and

<span className="">“Yes,  it  is  true;  I’m  in  a  terrific 
hurry.  Always  bewildered  and 
frustrated,  I  am  rushing  off  to  meet 
Krsna.  His  association  is  said  to 
give  the  greatest  solace.  Fear  and 
depression  have  accompanied  me 
all my life. I have been told that once 
one  meets  Krsna,  never  again  will 
depression  or  fear  shadow  such  a 
fortunate  person.  Please  forgive  me, 
my  friend.  I  am  always  in  a  terrific 
hurry.  I  may  die  soon.  If  I  do  not 
meet  with  Krsna  Prema,  my  life  will 
have been a failure. Please come with 
me. Let us fully prepare ourselves to 
receive Him. He is so dear, but rarely 
makes Himself available. This may be 
our one and only chance. Let us not 
take one second for granted.”
</span><br>
<span className="">Questions &amp; Answers
Question: Sometimes our chanting is so inattentive 
and our minds are just crazy, which makes it hard to 
love Krsna in such a state. If we at least keep up the 
determination and faith, will we have some hope?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: In the neophyte state, the mind constantly 
harasses us with haunting impressions from the past 
and picks up stimulation from the immediate environ-
ment. To the degree that we identify with the mind, 
the mind will concomitantly cause many complexi-

</span><br>
<span className="">Flowing Tears of Love
</span><br>
<span className="">ties. However, if we see the mind as different from 
ourselves,  we  will  be  able  to  look  at  the  mind  and 
say, “Oh, it is just the mind doing its thing.” Similarly, 
at the first point of bhava, there will be causes for 
agitation but we must not allow ourselves to accept 
or identify with it from the heart. This comes from 
practice. Although the mind will act in its own way, 
we must have purified intelligence. We can purify the 
intelligence through association with the scriptures 
and association with good examples. Then the intel-
ligence will be able to reflect on and remind itself of 
the attainable goal with readiness to pay the price. 
This kind of determination comes from association. 
If  we  have  quality  association  and  take  advantage 
of  it,  this  association  will  infect  us.  Conversely,  if 
we associate with the materialists and imbibe their 
association, we will be infected by the diseases they 
carry.
</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  You  mentioned  earlier  that  materialists 
seem  to  actively  try  to  avoid  blessings.  Can  you 
elaborate on this point?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: Sometimes we stress that the conditioned 
soul  works  overtime  to  try  to  deny  the  simple,  the 
genuine  and  the  sublime.  The  existence  of  God  is 
obvious,  and  the  suffering  caused  by  the  material 
body  is  obvious,  but  most  people  do  not  accept 
these facts. Therefore, they often use extra endeavor 
to see the world and act without recognizing Krsna 
as the supreme proprietor.

<span className="">Question:  Are  the  rasas  in  the  spiritual  world 
similar to the mundane world? For example, a come-
dian does an act and every time you remember his 
act,  you  laugh.  Is  this  similar  to  Krsna’s  pastimes? 
Or,  in  Krsna’s  pastimes  for  example,  you  picture 
Mother  Yasoda  trying  to  bind  baby  Krsna  but  the 
rope  always  ends  up  two  inches  short.  Every  time 
you remember this pastime, you laugh. It is similar?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  It  is  just  like  the  example  you  gave  of 
someone telling a joke. Sometimes a person tells a 
joke and nobody laughs or picks up on its dynamics 
because  they  simply  cannot  tune  into  the  specific 
culture. In different parts of the world, people joke 
about  different  subjects  and  the  jokes  of  other 
cultures  might  not  register  or  seem  funny  to  an 
American,  because  they  deal  with  lifestyles  and 
idiosyncratic tendencies. For those who have love of 
Krsna  and  who  are  His  unalloyed  devotees,  every-
thing that Krsna does is fantastic. Of course, certain 
activities  are  stimulating  in  an  adventurous  way, 
funny way, and so many other ways. The comedian 
is  a  good  example  because  a  good  comedian  will 
tell  different  jokes  according  to  the  audience.  One 
audience may pick up on political jokes and another 
group  may  enjoy  other  themes.  The  pure  devotees 
have an inside connection which is not necessarily 
secretive.  For  instance,  Lord  Caitanya  and  His  inti-
mate  associates  had  nighttime  kirtanas  in  which 
the mood of association between the pure devotees 
differed greatly from the mood of the public. There

<span className="">was a different language, different level of communi-
cation and different sensitivity. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: For someone like me who does not know 
the philosophy, is there any hope for me to become 
Krsna conscious?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  You  could  not  speak  in  this  way  if  you 
were not already somewhat serious. Great devotees 
also  speak  in  this  way.  Actually,  Srila  Prabhupada 
did  not  consider  himself  to  be  a  great  scholar  and 
the  prayers  of  the  great  acaryas  also  reveal  their 
humility.  Srila  Gaurakisora  dasa  Babaji  was  illit-
erate.  Scholarship  is  not  a  qualification  for  making 
advancement. Knowledge and austerity may help at 
the  initial  platform  but  genuine  progress  requires 
deep  understanding.  As  we  engage  in  a  proper 
activity  with  understanding,  the  activity  has  more 
potency.  However,  understanding  is  not  based  on 
scholarship, because we can read and hear so much 
but  not  really  understand.  If  we  really  understand 
something, it will change our lives. If we analyze our 
own  lives,  we  may  find  that  we  cannot  understand 
beyond a certain point because we hear but do not 
then change our lives. To what degree do we act upon 
what we hear? Krsna consciousness is not in any way 
limited by gender, race, part of the world or even any 
time of creation. It is not limited by wealth, beauty or 
knowledge. We know that only bhakti brings bhakti. 
We  have  to  absorb  the  mind  and  intelligence  and 
feed them with this knowledge simply because they

<span className="">191
</span><br>
<span className="">Reflections On Sacred Teachings, Volume One
</span><br>
<span className="">are rascals. If they were not such rascals, we would 
not have to feed them so much. Even Lord Caitanya 
emphatically  shows  this  fact,  because  although  he 
did not write many books, he wanted books written 
and  asked  others  to  write  them.  He  did  not  write 
books  but  He  gave  us  a  few  very  basic  things  that 
actually encompass everything. For this reason, Srila 
Prabhupada explains in the Bhagavad-gita that one 
can  become  Krsna  conscious  in  many  lifetimes  or 
literally in moments. It all depends on how quickly 
we can accept the facts.
</span><br>
<span className="">In  many  cases,  if  we  have  intellectual  propensi-
ties,  they  must  be  engaged  or  they  will  go  towards 
the many attractions of the material energy. Usually, 
without proper piety, the intellectual propensity can 
cause  interference  because  the  mind  will  be  more 
active  and  able  to  rationalize  materialism.  We  will 
consider ourselves to be more important, which will 
cause the false ego to interfere. However, if we have 
this propensity and can control it sufficiently, we can 
make it wonderful by offering it to Krsna. Our intel-
ligence can be used for preaching. But again, it has 
nothing to do with advancement. For example, it is 
wonderful that so many speakers come to the temple 
and  give  different  courses  on  different  topics.  But, 
if  one  does  not  act  upon  the  knowledge  and  give 
up  sense  gratification,  it  becomes  another  form  of 
enjoyment rather than service. We have to be careful 
to not want to just enjoy Krsna or the philosophy. We 
have to hear it, use it and apply it. Otherwise, we will 
become  wonderful  philosophers  or  panditas  who

<span className="">are ready to lash at each other with sastra while we 
claim our territory and a material heritage instead of 
spiritual heritage. Consequently, aparadhas can set 
in.  We  discussed  quite  a  bit  about  humility,  which 
goes much deeper than we normally think. Without 
humility as an ongoing factor in our lives, there will 
be many obstacles. Even though we can understand 
a  great  deal,  there  will  be  many  obstacles  and 
little ability to work through them. We must always 
humble ourselves in spite of whatever we have or do 
not have.
</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  I  feel  really  worthless,  particularly  as 
we begin the sixth, seventh, and eighth verses and 
discuss bhava. When I read these verses, I just do 
not feel it and feel like a phony. I understand that we 
need to trust in the process, but it feels like a duty to 
recite them every morning and feel nothing.
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  For  this  reason,  we  should  review  our 
daily  activities.  At  a  certain  point  we  do  want  to 
learn something new, but it is more important to go 
deeper into what we already have. Everything is here. 
In actuality, after just a few days in the association 
of devotees, we receive most of what is necessary. If 
we really appreciated the essential, especially these 
last slokas, we would not be conditioned souls. It is 
not unusual to have no appreciation and to not feel 
these symptoms. Hearing these last few slokas can 
even make us fearful because the mind and intelli-
gence want to shout out: “No! No! No!”

</span><br>
<span className="">Once  a  devotee  told  Srila  Prabhupada  that  he 
did  not  feel  humble  while  prostrating  himself  and 
offering  obeisances.  Srila  Prabhupada  explained 
that he should do it anyway and the understanding 
will come as long as one does not have strong resis-
tance. Sometimes we see two devotees arguing and 
one  suddenly  drops  and  offers  obeisances.  It  just 
changes the whole atmosphere. If you are angry and 
shouting at someone but the person says, “Prabhu, 
I’m  really  sorry.”  and  offers  obeisances,  your  heart 
changes and the whole atmosphere changes. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question:  How  do  we  rid  ourselves  of  the  more 
subtle contaminations in the heart?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer:  This  question  relates  to  the  third  sloka. 
One  should  chant  the  holy  name  of  the  Lord  in  a 
humble  state  of  mind,  thinking  oneself  lower  than 
the straw in the street, and being more tolerant than 
a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige. And the 
key is to be ready to offer all respects to others. We 
need  to  go  beyond  just  self-examination  and  the 
endeavor to develop tolerance, humility and submis-
siveness,  by  focusing  on  the  active  and  positive 
engagements instead of just stopping the negative. 
When  proper  humility  is  established,  one  is  eager 
to respect, serve and honor others. We do not avoid 
the  service,  feel  any  grudges  or  simply  focus  on 
ourselves. In this way, humility sets in and the subtle 
contaminations begin to leave. Sometimes devotees 
can even fake humility but everything still revolves

<span className="">12/26/02, 3:21 PM

<span className="">Flowing Tears of Love
</span><br>
<span className="">around  them,  which  means  that  they  cannot  really 
honor  a  Vaisnava  or  feel  love  for  Vaisnavas.  They 
remain stuck in moksa consciousness, thinking only 
in relation to their growth, their understanding, their 
salvation, their development, etc. 
</span><br>
<span className="">However,  this  is  not  the  mindset  of  our  eternal 
home, the spiritual world. The more we try to think 
and act in the mindset of home, the more we will be 
prepared to go home. We are in prison now, trying 
to  get  paroled.  We  have  begun  to  hear  and  think 
about the activities outside the prison and need to 
prepare ourselves for that lifestyle. We are endeav-
oring  to  make  a  complete  paradigm  shift.  We  no 
longer want to see through the glasses of the mate-
rial  world  but  we  want  to  understand  the  activities 
and thought processes of those who are free of the 
disease. Then, as we act like those who are free, we 
begin to understand and become like them. Other-
wise, we can accomplish so much but still maintain 
the basic old patterns and archetypes of the mate-
rial  energy.  If  we  serve  with  these  old  patterns, 
our  service  will  only  endure  for  a  short  period. 
Devotional  service  is  very  serious  and  nothing  can 
remain  hidden.  When  we  receive  more  resources 
such as money, manpower or opportunities to serve, 
if we do not become simultaneously more humble, 
we  will  get  electrocuted.  Without  strong  humility, 
Krsna  will  arrange  an  external  situation  that  will 
cause  an  actual  physical  falldown  due  to  a  lack  of 
humility.  Krsna  does  not  accept  bribes.  When  you 
offer  something  without  the  right  consciousness,  it

<span className="">Verse 7
</span><br>
<span className="">Mood of Separation
</span><br>
<span className="">I cannot say much about the last two Siksastaka 
verses,  which  in  one  sense,  is  contradictory  since 
these  two  especially  contain  the  full  expression  of 
devotion, prema, or pure love of God. These topics 
are very deep and beyond my level of appreciation, 
but  we  will  try  to  investigate  some  points  given 
by  our  great  predecessors  such  as  Bhaktivinoda 
Thakura  and  Bhaktisiddhanta  Sarasvati  Thakura. 
Verse  seven  emphasizes  the  mood  of  separation, 
or vipralambha. Verse eight concludes with the full 
mood of the highest perfection, or we should say it 
actually begins with that mood, because what Lord 
Caitanya has given has no end. Verse eight connects 
us with the great blessing of Lord Caitanya’s appear-
ance  in  this  world  as  the  combination  of  mother-
father God and as a combination of Krsna and His 
hladini potency. Krsna comes to experience His own 
gift, and He shares it freely with the inhabitants of 
this  world.  Caitanya  Mahaprabhu  distributes  and 
benedicts in the most magnanimous way whether we 
are qualified or unqualified. Everyone is exposed to 
the ultimate mood of Vraja, which has been brought

lower energy.

</span><br>
<span className="">This  is  the  mood  of  separation  experienced  by 
those who have attained the highest goal or for those 
who  are  ongoing  possessors  such  as  the  nitya-
siddhas.  We  can  approach  this  in  different  ways 
but  one  way  is  through  an  example  in  our  present 
environment. We had a wonderful visiting guru here 
who  only  left  a  few  hours  ago,  but  we  can  already 
feel some separation. So many wonderful devotees 
have  visited  in  the  past  and  when  they  leave,  we 
feel some separation. Sometimes we use secular or 
mundane examples because we can relate to them. 
For instance, a drug addict is accustomed to taking 
drugs  everyday.  If  they  cannot  access  that  drug,

<span className="">their  whole  life  becomes  totally  disoriented.  Their 
mental and physical aspects become disturbed and 
their body experiences withdrawal symptoms. They 
experience  anger  and  tension,  and  because  their 
life  revolves  around  the  drug,  without  it  everything 
becomes  practically  useless.  Life  cannot  continue 
without  it.  We  can  also  see  this  mood  manifest  in 
lovers  who  experience  the  pain  of  separation  even 
though it is merely “love” in the material world.
</span><br>
<span className="">The Pain of Separation
</span><br>
<span className="">The more wonderful something is, the more diffi-
cult it becomes to not have it. And if something has 
become  an  integral  part  of  our  ongoing  existence, 
its  absence  will  cause  feelings  of  nothingness.  Its 
absence will cause us to feel almost dead. Sometimes 
it  even  takes  people’s  lives.  For  instance,  maybe  a 
husband and wife have been together for a long time 
such as 40, 50 or 60 years, but one suddenly dies. 
Often, the other person will die within months. The 
mind  affects  the  body  in  such  circumstances  and 
they  basically  lose  the  desire  to  live  since  such  an 
integral  part  of  them  has  gone  with  nothing  left  to 
replace it. All of their endeavors simply bring them 
more  frustration.  They  lived  together  in  the  house 
for 50 years, woke up together every morning, and 
spent their afternoons and evenings in each other’s 
association.  Now  he  or  she  is  stuck  in  the  house 
alone and has to do everything alone, which makes 
their  whole  life  totally  miserable.  Their  whole  life 
experience  revolved  around  the  association  of  the

</span><br>
<span className="">other  person  and  they  based  the  meaning  of  their 
activities on this association. It is as if a certain part 
of them dies or as if half of the body becomes para-
lyzed. You try to continue enjoying without the other 
half of the body or without the use of hands, arms or 
maybe legs, but you are simply not the same person. 
You  deal  with  everything  differently,  in  a  state  of 
anxiety, frustration and gloom. Although the object 
of affection was perhaps not very deep in how they 
would reciprocate with you and how you would recip-
rocate in return, still the loss is tremendous. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Some  people  become  almost  insane  and  suffer 
so much when they lose even their cat or dog. They 
cannot  eat  or  sleep.  The  drug  addict  also  suffers 
from this type of reaction. Eating and sleeping mean 
nothing to them. Or when someone gets their heart 
broken by their so-called lover, they may lose enthu-
siasm for their regular activities for weeks, months, 
years  or  even  for  the  rest  of  their  life.  Everything 
simply  becomes  mechanical.  They  eat  but  have  no 
taste for the food. They sleep only when they cannot 
keep  the  body  awake  any  longer.  They  have  no 
desire for eating, sleeping or anything else. We have 
all had these experiences to different degrees. Our 
reflection on the loss or separation can completely 
absorb us. The more we accepted the object as an 
integral part of our lives, the more difficult the sepa-
ration becomes.

<span className="">ultimate Lover. It is intense pain and anxiety but, at 
the  same  time,  it  is  not.  In  the  pure  state,  separa-
tion  does  not  really  exist,  because  the  meditation 
on Krsna always remains strong even during the so-
called  separation.  A  pure  entity  who  thinks  of  the 
topmost  pureness  may  seem  to  experience  even 
more  anxiety  but  it  is  really  more  absorption  and 
love. But the intensity is there so we use the example 
of separation but emphasize the intensity. We realize 
that the experience is much more intense because 
the subject or object is much more dynamic. Imagine 
the  intensity  experienced  by  certain  entities  when 
they  absorb  themselves  in  devastating  drugs  or  in 
relationships  basically  based  on  lust.  Then,  when 
they  cannot  be  with  their  partner  in  lust,  they  lose 
their  desire  to  live.  However,  we  hear  these  same 
expressions from these great souls who say that life 
is  meaningless,  useless  and  worthless  without  the 
association of Krsna. Feeling this separation seems 
to turn a short moment or small interval into twelve 
years or more. “Tears are flowing from my eyes like 
torrents  of  rain  and  I  am  feeling  all  vacant  in  the 
world  in  Your  absence.”  We  may  have  felt  suicidal 
at times, wondering about the reasons for living any 
longer.  Due  to  material  anxieties  and  frustrations, 
people lose focus and purpose in life. They look at 
their  past,  present  and  future  situations  and  see 
only more misery and suffering. Consequently, they 
think, “No, I cannot bear any more. I cannot go on. I 
want out of this suffering.”

<span className="">Preparing to Return Home
</span><br>
<span className="">As  we  previously  explained,  singing,  dancing, 
dressing,  etc.  is  all  ultimately  meant  for  Krsna’s 
enjoyment  in  the  association  of  Krsna’s  devotees 
in  the  spiritual  world.  All  of  our  current  endeavors 
are just the activities of the prisoners or conditioned 
souls  in  the  prison.  As  devotees,  we  are  practicing 
for  our  real  activities  in  the  spiritual  world.  People 
are  acting,  sporting,  behaving  chivalrously,  etc., 
because these are really the eternal activities in the 
spiritual world for Krsna. For instance, you may take 
my coat and claim it as your own although it really 
belongs to me. This false proprietorship of the coat 
is  not  grounded.  It  is  illusory  because  the  object 
really belongs to someone else. Therefore, although 
you  may  look  at  it,  use  it  and  claim  it,  it  does  not 
belong to you. We are like thieves. Although we try 
to  steal  Krsna’s  property,  He  just  gives  us  a  small 
replica  or  toy  to  prevent  us  from  creating  distur-
bances  because  there  can  be  no  imperfections  in 
the spiritual kingdom. If the mother is cooking and 
the  child  is  disturbing  her,  the  mother  may  give 
the child a small toy cook set and say, “Okay, now 
you  bake  a  cake,  sweetheart.”  The  child  may  then 
pretend to bake and become absorbed for a period 
of  time.  Cooking  is  a  real  activity  and  the  child  is 
imitating this activity. The replica indicates that the 
real  activity  actually  exists.  The  artificial  reflection 
exists  because  the  real  activity  exists,  but  the  real 
activity is more than we can handle.

<span className="">Reflections On Sacred Teachings, Volume One
</span><br>
<span className="">just a replica of the intensity of our connection with 
Krsna.  The  difference  is  that  the  spiritual  intensity 
and  anxiety  is  an  expression  of  various  bhavas  or 
ecstasies  or  even  different  levels  of  prema.  This 
anxiety  stimulates  a  greater  expression  of  love 
between the living entity and Krsna. It is slight word 
jugglery to refer to this expression as painful, for it is 
not pain as we understand it. It is separation but not 
separation. Similarly, we can try to explain time in a 
material sense but then look at time in the spiritual 
world. Time exists in the spiritual world, but simul-
taneously there is no time. Krsna has always existed 
and will always exist. His pastimes are eternal and 
He  always  extends  His  love.  It  is  not  that  His  love 
started  at  some  point  and  will  ever  stop.  It  will 
always remain. However, we talk about the different 
activities  that  happen  at  intervals  or  at  different 
periods  of  the  day.  The  physical  body  and  senses 
are limited to only one realm of experience but the 
soul is not limited. One sense of the eternal soul can 
perform all the functions of the other senses. From 
this reflection, we can understand that expressions 
and activities do take place in the spiritual realm but 
the experiences are completely different. The senses 
of the physical body are very limited and only tuned 
into the experience of each particular sense. There 
are  no  barriers  limiting  the  spiritual  body  and  the 
soul is part and parcel of the Lord.
</span><br>
<span className="">In  one  sense,  there  is  really  nothing  more  than 
Krsna  interacting  with  Himself,  meaning  that  the 
living  entities  are  just  part  and  parcel  of  Krsna.

</span><br>
<span className="">Therefore,  everything  is  possible  and  everything  is 
perfectly arranged. Although we are in the material 
world, we are still part and parcel of Krsna but are 
experiencing some static due to our rebelliousness. 
In the spiritual kingdom, there is no static and every-
thing is simultaneously possible. So Krsna explains 
that, when he hides Himself, He is really making an 
arrangement  to  increase  the  love  of  His  servants. 
Srila  Bhaktivinoda  Thakura  shares  a  few  points  in 
this regard. Previously, we discussed bhava in sloka 
six.  When  this  bhava-bhakti  becomes  steady  and 
permanent,  it  turns  into  sthayi-bhava  and  then  it 
grades  into  prema.  In  slokas  seven  and  eight,  we 
will discuss the prema that emerges from the bhava. 
Srila Rupa Gosvami states in his  Bhakti-rasamrta-
sindhu 1.4.1: 
</span><br>
<span className="">“Bhava-bhakti  which,  from  its  very 
first  stages,  so  excessively  affects 
the  heart  that  it  melts  and  becomes 
a sublime salve of love, bringing the 
highest feelings of divine bliss within 
reach,  and  generates  an 
intense 
desire  for  Krsna.  The  fully  perfected 
souls term this over-vaulting ecstasy 
as prema.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">The word mamata refers to the sense of posses-
siveness  that  occurs  when  one  thinks  of  Krsna  as 
one’s master, friend, son or lover.

<span className="">“When  anuraga 
</span><br>
<span className="">is  filled  with 
unsurpassable 
and  matchless 
magnificence  of  love,  reaching  the 
it  becomes 
plateau  of  madness, 
maha-bhava.  In  this  stage,  even  the 
blinking  of  an  eyelid  veiling  the 
view  of  the  beloved  for  less  than  a 
moment,  becomes  intolerable,  and 
seconds  stretch  to  eons.  Separation 
for even a moment seems to expand 
to timeless eternity.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">Sri Siksastaka, 62
</span><br>
<span className="">Of course, this is the expression of mahabhava. 
How  can  one  feel  vipralambha  or  love  in  separa-
tion  when  one  has  not  met  Krsna?  We  can  under-
stand  the  concept  of  vipralambha  in  the  spiritual 
world  because  one  is  sometimes  with  Krsna  and 
sometimes not with Him. However, if one has never 
met  Krsna,  how  can  one  experience  this  emotion? 
For  instance,  before  Krsna’s  arrival  in  Mathura, 
the ladies of the city felt such separation from Him 
although  they  never  even  met  Him.  Rukmini  also 
never  actually  met  Krsna  but  felt  the  intense  pains 
of separation in a mood similar to the mood of the 
residents  of  Vraja.  How  was  it  possible  for  her  to 
feel such emotions? The answer is simply by hearing 
about Krsna. From this, such emotions arise in the 
heart.

</span><br>
<span className="">Mood of Separation
</span><br>
<span className="">Types of Separation
</span><br>
<span className="">There are ten different types of vipralambha, or 
separation. In English, the first is called anxiousness. 
The second is insomnia. Many of us may have had 
this  experience  after  something  intense  happened 
in our lives and we could not eat or sleep for several 
days. If you have not experienced such, you are very 
unfortunate. Sometimes the intense anxiety gives us 
amazing  realizations.  This  kind  of  clearing  can  be 
very healthy and can help us gain more insights. In 
literature, there is a similar conception of the tragic 
hero. The hero learns extensively from his different 
adventures, anxieties and sufferings that lead him to 
become a greater or more aware person. The third 
type is agitation. Number four is  emaciation of  the 
body.  Number  five  is  discoloration  of  the  limbs  of 
the body. Number six is incoherent speech. Number 
seven is being attacked with a chronic ailment. Eight 
is madness, nine is bewilderment and ten is giving 
up the body. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Even  mundane  psychologists  and  psychiatrists 
are  now  introducing  the  conception  that  madness 
in certain people may result from a spiritual emer-
gency or a spiritual crisis. There is a whole science 
in  relation  to  this  conception.  As  we  try  to  deal 
with this material world and pursue spiritual under-
standing,  it  causes  trauma  and  incoherence  as  a 
result of the shedding. If we do no receive guidance 
through certain challenges, it can lead to what the 
materialists label as a mental breakdown. Actually, it 
can be a stage of development and unfoldment that

</span><br>
<span className="">207
</span><br>
<span className="">Reflections On Sacred Teachings, Volume One
</span><br>
<span className="">sets a platform to move on to a higher phase. The 
expressions  of  vipralambha  compare  to  madness 
because one will be insensitive to certain things and 
very sensitive to other things. A person experiencing 
these symptoms would seem very abnormal. Those 
psychiatrists who have been involved in spiritual disci-
plines  can  understand  what  happens  when  certain 
chakras  open,  when  someone  receives  certain 
realizations,  or  when  an  overwhelming  experience 
cannot easily be processed into the consciousness. 
A  person  in  this  condition  may  appear  to  be  mad. 
They may tune out the regular experiences, develop 
tremendous  greed  for  spiritual  understanding,  and 
develop disgust for certain day to day activities that 
people accept as important. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Several  issues  are  becoming  very  strange  to 
‘normal’  therapists.  In  this  period  of  world  history 
and  in  this  aspect  of  Kali-yuga,  there  are  many 
unusual  situations  and  occurrences.  Ultimately, 
they are all to help people develop a greater appre-
ciation and understanding of the human condition, 
the mind, intelligence and the soul. The tenth type 
of separation is unconsciousness and death. When 
someone  experiences  these  anxieties  due  to  the 
death of another, drugs or maybe the loss of a job, 
they  can  become  manic-depressive.  Some  people 
even experience manic depression just from losing 
their  jobs.  It  simply  overwhelms  them.  Their  whole 
life  revolved  around  a  certain  arrangement,  and 
due to an abrupt change, they simply cannot cope. 
However,  these  are  all  just  reflections  of  the  real

<span className="">experience  in  the  same  way  that  the  child  plays 
with  the  toy  kitchen  set.  The  perverted  reflection 
exists  simply  because  the  reality  exists.  In  conclu-
sion to this seventh sloka, Lord Caitanya says in the 
Caitanya-caritamrta, Antya-lila 20.40-41: 
</span><br>
<span className="">“In  My  agitation,  a  day  never 
ends,  for  every  moment  seems  like 
a  millennium.  Pouring 
incessant 
tears, My eyes are like clouds in the 
rainy  season.  The  three  worlds  have 
become  void  because  of  separation 
from  Govinda.  I  feel  as  if  I  were 
burning alive in a slow fire.”

</span><br>
<span className="">My Worshipful Lord, 
Unconditionally
</span><br>
<span className="">The  last  verse,  sloka  number  eight,  deals  with 
obtaining the highest perfection of one’s cherished 
goal  or  prayojana.  This  last  verse  concludes  the 
Siksastaka  prayers  and  gives  a  last  reflection  to 
meditate  upon.  The  expression  is  profound  and 
opposes  all  patterns  of  material  consciousness.  It 
is  the  complete,  diametrical  opposite  of  material 
consciousness.  Even  as  devotees,  when  we  read 
this, it sends chills down our spines.

<span className="">My Worshipful Lord, Unconditionally
</span><br>
<span className="">and everything, for He is always my 
worshipful Lord, unconditionally.”
</span><br>
<span className="">This verse makes some people want to run out of 
the  temple.  “Hold  on  a  minute!  I  joined  the  wrong 
movement! I thought I was joining this movement in 
order to get all of my desires and aspirations fulfilled. 
God is love and He is supposed to make me happy. 
Therefore, I will pray and call on His name so that He 
will quickly and expediently fulfill my desires!” Here 
Krsna fully explains how to attain Him. He Himself 
receives  this  ultimate  love  unconditionally  and 
ceaselessly and speaks in this way. “You can handle 
me roughly, You can make me brokenhearted or You 
can even decide not to be present, which is all right 
because You are free to do anything and everything. 
Always  You  shall  remain  my  worshipable  Lord.” 
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita 18.66 to abandon all 
varieties of religion:
</span><br>
<span className="">sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
</span><br>
<span className="">He gives Arjuna all kinds of instruction but then 
emphasizes  that  one  should  abandon  all  varieties 
of religiosity. He tells him to abandon the pursuit of 
Brahman,  of  varnasrama-dharma  and  even  of  all 
religiosity. He says, “Do not worry and do not hesi-
tate. I shall protect you.” Krsna asks the living entities

</span><br>
<span className="">Reflections On Sacred Teachings, Volume One
</span><br>
<span className="">to make themselves fully available and categorically 
states that He will do His part as we do our part.
</span><br>
<span className="">In  this  prayer,  given  by  Lord  Caitanya  in  the 
mood of the gopis, the only concern is the pleasure 
and  happiness  of  Krsna.  Material  sociologists  and 
psychologists  will  categorize  this  as  some  kind  of 
tremendous mental problem. They might view such 
expressions as almost masochistic since the gopis 
say,  “Do  as  You  like  but  you  will  always  be  mine, 
even  if  You  give  me  distress.  Such  distress  will  be 
my  greatest  source  of  happiness  if  it  makes  You 
happy and pleases You.” For this reason, we explain 
that  Krsna  consciousness  is  transcendental  since 
it  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  material  mindsets  of 
“I”  and  “mine.”  It  has  nothing  to  do  with  any  plea-
sure separate from the ultimate source of pleasure, 
Krsna. Therefore, Krsna consciousness is in disguise 
because it is really about attaining the highest sense 
gratification, which far surpasses the dull and limited 
senses. We are not referring to the temporary phys-
ical  bodies  that  always  harass  and  disappoint  us. 
We are not referring to relationships with so-called 
lovers who ultimately disappoint us or cannot under-
stand us. We are also not speaking of relationships 
that leave us hoping for an improvement or a deeper 
connection  or  relationships  in  which  each  partner 
has  their  own  secrets  and  cannot  fully  connect. 
Krsna  does  not  ask  for  anything  that  He  does  not 
already have. He simply asks us to give up the false 
illusion of proprietorship that causes our suffering. 
Everything  follows  His  path  and  resides  under  His

<span className="">control  but  we  think  differently;  therefore,  we  have 
to  suffer.  Due  to  our  materialistic  mentality,  the 
word  ‘surrender’  in  our  English  language  carries  a 
connotation  of  defeat  caused  by  a  stronger  power 
who forces the weaker party to surrender. One has 
to surrender since they have been overpowered and 
have no other choice. When we view surrender as a 
commitment to an insecure or hostile situation, the 
mindset will accompany us. However, if we consider 
ourselves to be in danger, in pain, lost or suffering 
and  surrender  in  this  mood,  the  act  of  surrender 
compares to a small child who runs and surrenders 
into  the  arms  of  the  mother  or  father  in  order  to 
receive  love  and  protection.  Actually,  surrender  is 
literally falling back in love with the Lord in the land 
of love and coming to the embrace of the Lord. In 
this sense, surrender has an entirely different conno-
tation. It no longer refers to the grudging situation of 
being  overpowered  and  thinking,  “Now  we  have  to 
act against our will due to their force and will now 
lose our individuality and identity.” No, it is the oppo-
site because we actually reclaim our real identity in 
our eternal associations with the Lord.

<span className="">This  last  verse  expresses  how  to  once  again 
experience  this  reality  in  its  totality.  This  expres-
sion  reveals  the  mind  and  consciousness  of  those 
who  are  already  having  the  experience.  If  we  want 
to acquire something, we should follow the example 
of those who already have it in order to obtain the 
same  result.  Lord  Caitanya  speaks  as  the  perfect 
devotee  in  the  mood  of  Srimati  Radharani  and  in

<span className="">the mood of the damsels of Vraja, who have His love 
fully in this particular mood. They only think about 
Krsna’s care and love and, because they are all for 
Him, He is all for them. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam 
11.29.34, Krsna says:
</span><br>
<span className="">“When the mortal beings decide to 
relinquish  all  fruitive  activities  and 
their results, and fully surrender unto 
Me,  I  reciprocate  by  giving  them  the 
nectar of immortality, elevating them 
to become My eternal associates.” 
</span><br>
<span className="">All for Krsna
</span><br>
<span className="">Lord  Krsna  Himself  says  in  the  Srimad-Bhaga-
</span><br>
<span className="">vatam 10.32.22: 
</span><br>
<span className="">“My  dear  gopis,  you  have  severed 
all family bindings for My sake. Such 
an  achievement  is  very  rare,  even 
for  great  philosophers  and  yogis. 
Our  meetings  with  each  other  are 
completely  pure  and  unblemished. 
If  I  wanted  to  repay  the  debt  that  I 
have incurred by your love, devotion, 
service  and  renunciation,  even  with 
My  immortal  body  for  all  eternity,  I 
would  be  unable.  I  am  obligated  to 
you  life  after  life.  You  may  succeed 
in acquitting Me of this debt by your 
gentle  and  divine  demeanor—nay,

</span><br>
<span className="">your  sublime  love;  but  I  will  always 
remain indebted to you.”
</span><br>
<span className="">Here we see the intensity. They are all for Krsna 
and Krsna is all for them. He claims that He cannot 
repay them. Even if they somehow write off His debt, 
He  still  feels  indebted  to  them.  Sri  Krsna  says  in 
Srimad-Bhagavatam 10.32.21:
</span><br>
<span className="">“O beloved gopis, there is no doubt 
that for My sake you have disregarded 
social taboos, Vedic injunctions, even 
cut yourselves off from your relatives 
and family members. Your meditation 
on  Me  has  been  single-minded,  not 
thinking at all of your beauty or your 
nuptial  bliss.  In  order  to  increase 
your  love  for  Me  I  disappeared  from 
your  sight.  Please  do  not  blame  Me 
for this act of love, because you are 
as dear to Me as I am to you.”
</span><br>
<span className="">Krsna explains that He purposely makes Himself 
unavailable  in  order  to  enhance  the  love  that  He 
allows them to experience and to increase His own 
experience of love for them. We find further elabora-
tion  in  the  Caitanya-caritamrta,  Antya-lila  20.48-
52: 
</span><br>
<span className="">“I  am  a  maidservant  at  the  lotus 
feet  of  Krsna.  He  is  the  embodiment

<span className="">transcendental  happiness  and 
of 
mellows. If He likes, He can embrace 
Me tightly and make Me feel one with 
Him, or He may corrode My mind and 
body by not giving Me His audience. 
Nevertheless,  He  alone  is  the  Lord 
of  My  life.  My  dear  friend,  just  hear 
the  decision  of  My  heart.  Krsna  is 
the  Lord  of  My  life  in  all  conditions, 
whether  He  shows  Me  affection  or 
kills Me by making Me unhappy. 
</span><br>
<span className="">“Sometimes  Krsna  gives  up  the 
company  of  the  other  gopis  and 
becomes  controlled,  mind  and  body, 
by  Me.  Thus  He  manifests  My  good 
fortune  and  gives  others  distress  by 
performing  His  loving  affairs  with 
Me.  After  all,  since  He  is  a  cunning 
and  obstinate  debauchee  with  a 
propensity  to  cheat,  He  takes  to 
the  company  of  other  women.  He 
indulges  in  loving  affairs  with  them 
in  front  of  Me  just  to  give  distress 
to  My  mind.  Nevertheless,  He  is  still 
the Lord of My life. I do not mind My 
personal distress, I only wish for the 
happiness of Krsna, for His happiness 
is the goal of My life. However, if He 
feels  great  happiness  by  giving  Me 
distress,  that  distress  is  the  best  of 
My happiness.”

<span className="">As  previously  described,  it  is  separation  and  yet 
not  separation  because  they  always  think  of  the 
Lord.  The  more  one  thinks  of  spiritual  realities, 
the  more  one  associates  with  them  since  it  is  all 
the  same.  Materially  there  is  time  separation  and 
geographical  separation,  but  spiritually  there  is  no 
separation. For instance, in the spiritual world there 
are no demons but only the sentiments of their pres-
ence.  The  idea  of  demons  enhances  the  devotion. 
Radharani seemingly has a so-called husband, Abhi-
manyu, who is also meant to enhance the adventure 
and  loving  expressions.  When  we  take  all  of  these 
realities and put them in the material world, we have 
a little girl playing with her pretend cook set, which 
is  not  real  but  exists  because  the  reality  exists. 
Therefore,  our  feelings  of  separation  from  material 
objects  or  relationships  exist  only  because  of  the 
existence  of  the  real  spiritual  emotions.  When  one 
thinks  about  the  intensity  of  Krsna’s  love,  which  is 
separation  but  not  separation,  it  makes  one  want 
to  always  experience  Krsna’s  association.  So  the 
pure servants of Krsna are always eager for the next 
meeting with Krsna, knowing that His love and theirs 
will  continue  to  increase  and  unfold.  Krsna  wants 
to give more, and the living entities will simultane-
ously experience more, as they give more to Krsna. 
There is an ongoing competition and each moment 
becomes more intense. The material world is exactly 
the opposite. At every moment, something is dete-
riorating until eventually it can no longer function. In 
the spiritual sense, Krsna’s own pastimes are always

</span><br>
<span className="">unfolding to such an extent that even Ananta-sesa 
cannot keep up with all of His pastimes. Even Krsna 
cannot  keep  up  with  Himself  due  to  the  constant 
unfoldment.  This  material  world  is  the  realm  of 
disappointments, constant anxieties, constant antic-
ipation and frustration. On the other hand, the spiri-
tual world is an environment of constant adventure, 
constant  exploration  and  constant  loving  competi-
tion in which every second turns into a higher expe-
rience of Krsna’s love. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Questions &amp; Answers
Question:  During  this  interim  state  between  the 
theoretical  and  the  actual  realization,  how  can 
we  best  fix  our  consciousness  without  becoming 
impatient  and  thinking,  “Okay,  Krsna,  when  will  it 
come?”
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: The earlier slokas addressed these points. 
For  example,  the  first  verse  dealt  with  the  impor-
tance  of  the  congregational  chanting  of  the  Lord’s 
holy  name.  The  second  one  addressed  the  aware-
ness of one’s incompetence to chant the holy name. 
Although the name can bring everything, the living 
entities  are  so  unlucky  or  unfortunate  that  they 
remain  unwilling  or  unable  to  utilize  it  properly.  In 
sloka  number  three,  Lord  Caitanya  gives  us  the 
process to become fortunate and the key that opens 
the  door.  Sloka  four  deals  with  the  elimination  of 
unfavorable  desires  and  He  even  spells  several  of 
them out for us: no desire for wealth, no desire for

<span className="">beautiful women and no desire for many followers. 
He only wants His causeless devotional service. He 
is  showing  us  some  of  the  anarthas,  or  dust,  that 
covers the mirror and causes us to not see or under-
stand.  Number  five  gives  us  knowledge  about  the 
jiva’s original spiritual identity so that we can focus 
on  our  real  situation  as  servitors  who  have  fallen. 
The  sixth  sloka  describes  the  experience  of  one 
who has received the good fortune and come close 
to the Lord. The seventh sloka shows the mood of 
separation experienced by those who have come to 
this  topmost  platform.  The  eighth  sloka  discusses 
the  process  of  attaining  the  highest  perfection  or 
ultimate goal. We want to know what is genuine and 
what  is  artificial.  We  want  to  know  what  is  proper 
and what is not. So the Lord describes some of the 
expressions  of  a  genuine  soul.  Everything  begins 
from  this  point  of  taking  the  chanting  of  the  holy 
name  more  seriously.  It  goes  beyond  the  idea  of 
putting your hand on the beads and uttering with the 
mouth, but we must also consider the ten offenses 
when we chant our rounds. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: In relation to the eighth verse, it seems 
inconceivable  to  think  that  anyone  in  their  right 
mind would say that you are free to do anything and 
everything  but  will  always  remain  my  worshipable 
Lord unconditionally. In the back of my mind, I know 
that Krsna is God and He will reciprocate, but when 
I read this verse, I do not really mean it.

</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: We do not mean it because we do not trust 
Krsna or believe Him. When you trust someone and 
feel  that  they  care  about  you  even  more  than  you 
care for yourself, this understanding will dispel the 
fear. We will eagerly want to connect with that which 
is so wonderful. However, due to our anger, fear and 
envy of Krsna, such submissions sound very intense. 
Of course, these feelings are the reason for our posi-
tion here in the material world in material bodies. 
</span><br>
<span className="">If someone holds a gun to our head and demands 
that we surrender to them, we will not be so eager 
or  happy  about  the  situation.  However,  if  a  small 
child sees the mother and father standing with open 
arms,  then  the  child  runs  into  the  embrace  of  the 
parent. The child surrenders to that situation. When 
there is understanding of the love and receiving of 
the  love,  there  will  also  be  eagerness.  The  child 
literally  runs  to  the  parents.  So-called  lovers  will 
also  run  to  each  other  in  this  way,  considering  the 
beloved to be connected with many wonderful asso-
ciations.  However,  the  exact  opposite  occurs  when 
one  is  afraid  of  a  person  who  has  been  abusive 
or who they feel can hurt them. Our fear of Krsna, 
lack of trust, and our envy will lead to procrastina-
tion.  Material  life  is  a  form  of  craziness  so  we  find 
many  ways  to  avoid  being  loved  and  embraced  by 
the  Lord.  We  run  to  so  many  material  amenities, 
which eventually cause us pain. We may do this for 
many  lifetimes  until  we  finally  become  exhausted. 
Then the consciousness from previous lives follows 
us and in our present life they will no longer attract

<span className="">us  because  we  have  already  tried  everything  and 
have instead developed stronger faith. We may have 
engaged in some bhakti, which carries over so that 
we lose the taste for the material. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Question: Sometimes people will have desperation 
for God and cry for Him but lose this feeling of sepa-
ration when they come to our movement. Now they 
sort of “have” Him. Could this mean that they were 
more advanced in the beginning?
</span><br>
<span className="">Answer: Just go to a mosque, church or synagogue 
and  take  an  inventory  of  their  prayers  by  asking, 
“What  are  you  praying  for?”  They  would  tell  you, 
“My  uncle,  my  cousin,  my  niece,  my  daughter,  my 
job, etc.” They might even be crying in anxiety over 
these material considerations because of the blocks 
preventing  their  enjoyment  or  experience.  It  would 
be  hard  to  find  someone  crying  and  praying,  “My 
dear Lord, Thy will be done.” Actually, they are really 
crying  out  of  material  frustration.  Something  has 
interfered with their sense gratification and material 
life so they approach the Lord in material frustration 
due to disappointment or depression. They are not 
crying, “Oh Lord you are so wonderful. Do with me 
as  You  like.”  However,  the  Bible,  Koran  and  Torah 
all emphasize the idea of “Thy will be done.” These 
hidden, higher truths are there but they do not really 
take it that seriously. For instance, we fast and the 
materialists  and  pseudo-spiritualists  also  fast,  but 
they fast in a different mood. They want God to take

</span><br>
<span className="">notice of them and want to force Him to fulfill their 
desires quickly because after all, they are fasting for 
Him;  therefore,  they  feel  that  He  should  do  some-
thing for them. Do you think that they fast and pray, 
“Oh  dear  Lord,  You  can  make  me  broken-hearted, 
You can appear or not appear, for the rest of my life, 
I  am  Yours?”  No  way.  Even  devotees  rarely  pray  in 
this  mood.  Srila  Prabhupada  said  that  many  devo-
tees  will  end  up  in  the  heavenly  kingdom  because 
the quality of their devotion is still based on propri-
etorship  and  certain  material  enjoyments.  It  is  still 
based on only somewhat wanting Krsna but not fully. 
The demigods also somewhat have Krsna. Some of 
them talk to Him, receive orders from Him and even 
carry them out, but they still have their space, their 
sovereign area, their jurisdiction and their power of 
attorney.  Krsna  is  so  kind  that  He  accommodates 
them  but  as  they  increasingly  desire  a  change  of 
consciousness, He will also fulfill that desire.
</span><br>
<span className="">If we think of God as an autocrat and especially 
if  we  have  certain  issues  with  authority  in  the 
material  world,  this  will  make  it  more  difficult  to 
surrender.  Actually  Krsna  really  surrenders  to  us 
in the sense that He even became Arjuna’s chariot 
driver. He even washed the feet of all the guests at 
the Rajasuya ceremony. Krsna actually cried when 
He thought of the Pandava’s austerities and difficul-
ties  that  they  accepted  on  His  behalf.  It  is  really  a 
craziness  to  have  so  much  fear  of  Krsna  and  for 
so  many  lifetimes  to  constantly  find  many  other 
arms  to  take  shelter  of  instead  of  Krsna’s  arms.

</span><br>
<span className="">For endless lifetimes, we looked for many beautiful 
situations,  nice  connections  and  nice  associations 
although Krsna is there. In order to assist us in our 
crazy state, Krsna appears in the arca-vigraha, the 
Deity form, so that we can dress Him, gaze upon His 
form, feed Him, put Him to rest and wake Him up. 
These activities will help us out of this craziness of 
remaining separate. Instead of playing with toys, we 
are preparing and maturing for His association in the 
place  where  everything  is  about  Him.  For  those  of 
you who perform Deity worship, you can see that so 
much of your life revolves around the Deity. Due to 
the service, you might not be able to leave, you have 
to wake up at a certain time to wake the Deities, or 
you have to change your dhoti or sari. You may have 
to shorten a conversation because it is almost time 
for  the  arati.  All  of  these  engagements  will  allow 
one to gradually become fully Krsna conscious. The 
difficulty  arises  because  we  serve  with  our  limited 
material  body  and  crazy  mind,  but  in  spite  of  the 
obstacles,  we  can  gradually  offer  everything  to 
Krsna. Even for those who are not directly involved 
in the pujari service, so much still happens in rela-
tion to the Lord. This community is Krsna conscious 
because of the presence of the Deities. Due to Their 
presence,  we  are  hearing  about  the  Lord,  chanting 
His  names,  honoring  prasadam,  etc.  There  are  so 
many farms around Gita Nagari with pious families 
but  no  Deity,  no  Krsna.  This  one  important  aspect 
of  Krsna  consciousness  shows  our  difference  from 
pseudo-religions.  We  have  philosophy,  rituals  and

<span className="">ceremonies that go on in all types of religious orga-
nizations, but these groups all over the world do not 
have the installed Deities. The Deity makes a special 
aspect  of  communication  to  the  spiritual  world 
available.  We  should  always  think  more  and  more 
about  how  to  please  the  Deity  through  our  type  of 
association,  the  type  of  community  or  the  type  of 
environment.  In  this  way,  we  will  begin  to  think  of 
everything  as  being  all  for  Krsna.  Then  Krsna  will 
think all for us and this same Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, who owns and controls everything, will 
say that your love is so strong that He cannot even 
repay  you.  He  will  be  eternally  indebted  to  you.  It 
is  wonderful  to  have  a  rich  man  indebted  to  you. 
He  has  numerous  assets  and,  due  to  your  connec-
tion with him, you have a good situation for the rest 
of  your  life.  Imagine  Krsna,  who  owns  everything, 
saying, “I have you in my book. I am indebted to you. 
You own Me. You are Mine and I am yours eternally, 
beloved.”

<span className="">Conclusion
</span><br>
<span className="">Krsna comes into this hellish place in the form of 
Caitanya Mahaprabhu to experience what He Himself 
gives. Keep in mind that as He gives, He competes 
but always wins. Since He always wins, He wants to 
experience the love that He gives. For this reason, He 
comes as Caitanya Mahaprabhu to understand what 
Radharani  is  experiencing,  which  is  even  greater 
than what He is experiencing from Her. In this utmost 
experience, He gave us these Siksastaka prayers. If 
we  can  somehow  catch  up  with  these  prayers  and 
understand them, we will have nothing left to know, 
because  these  eight  prayers  contain  all  aspects  of 
Krsna  consciousness  and  the  spiritual  kingdom.  It 
includes  the  total  expression  of  receiving  Krsna’s 
love and the mood of those who have caught up with 
such.  We  are  trying  to  come  up  to  this  level  and, 
since  Lord  Caitanya  has  made  these  prayers  avail-
able, we should meditate more on their meaning in 
order to absorb them more deeply into the heart.
</span><br>
<span className="">As we have stated in the beginning of this book, 
considering  that  Lord  Caitanya  has  recently  left, 
we  can  reflect  on  the  significance  of  our  presence 
on this planet at this particular time. As we deeply 
access  all  the  amazing  literatures,  stories  and

<span className="">understandings  available,  we  can  begin  to  realize 
the  powerful  treasure  contained  within  these  eight 
verses.  We  should  recognize  this  valuable  key  that 
can  open  sacred  doors  to  the  spiritual  world.  As 
we  recite  these  slokas  daily,  we  should  constantly 
endeavor  to  enter  more  deeply  into  their  meaning 
and mystery. This Siksastaka states the conclusion 
of Krsna Consciousness and offers the culmination 
of all the Vedas; therefore, it is the necklace that all 
Vaisnavas should wear. A necklace worn around the 
neck practically touches the heart. These verses are 
essential for us and should always be kept close to

</span><br>
<span className="">Bhakti Tirtha Swami was born John E. Favors in a pious, 
</span><br>
<span className="">God-fearing  family.  as a child evangelist,  he appeared 
regu larly on television, and as a young man, he was a leader 
in Dr. martin Luther King, Jr.’s civil rights movement. at Princ-
eton University, he became president of the student council 
and also served as chairman of the Third world Coalition. 
although his main degree is in psychology, he has received 
accolades  in  many  other  fields,  including  politics,  african 
studies, and international law.
</span><br>
<span className="">Bhakti Tirtha Swami’s books are used as reference texts 
in  universities  and  leadership  organizations  throughout 
the world. many of his books have been printed in English, 
German,  French,  Spanish,  Portuguese,  macedonian,  Croa-
tian, Russian, Hebrew, Slovenian, Balinese, and italian.
</span><br>
<span className="">His  Holiness  has  served  as  assistant  Coordinator  for 
penal  reform  programs  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  Office 
of  the  Public  Defender,  and  as  a  director  of  several  drug 
abuse clinics in the United States. in addition, he has been 
a special consultant for Educational Testing Services in the 
U.S.a. and has managed campaigns for  politicians. Bhakti 
Tirtha  Swami  gained  international  recognition  as  a  repre-
sentative of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, particularly for 
his outstanding work with scholars in the former communist 
countries of Eastern Europe. 
</span><br>
<span className="">Bhakti  Tirtha  Swami  directly  oversaw  projects  in  the 
United States (particularly washington D.C., Potomac, mary-
land,  Detroit,  Pennsylvania,  west  Virginia),  west  africa, 
South africa, Switzerland, France, Croatia, and Bosnia. He 
also  served  as  the  director  of  the  american  Federation  of 
Vaisnava Colleges and Schools.
</span><br>
<span className="">in the United States, Bhakti Tirtha Swami was the founder 
and director of the institute for applied Spiritual Technology, 
director of the international Committee for Urban Spiritual 
Development,  and  one  of  the  international  coordinators 
of  the  Seventh  Pan  african  Congress.  Reflecting  his  wide 
range  of  interests,  he  was  also  a  member  of  the  institute 
for Noetic Sciences, the Center for Defense information, the 
United Nations association for america, the National Peace 
institute  Foundation,  the  world  Future  Society,  and  the 
Global Forum of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders.
</span><br>
<span className="">a specialist in international relations and conflict resolu-
tion,  Bhakti  Tirtha  Swami  constantly  traveled  around  the 
world and had become a spiritual consultant to many high-
ranking members of the United Nations, to various celebri-
ties, and to several chiefs, kings, and high court justices. in 
1990 His Holiness was coronated as a high chief in warri, 
Nigeria in recognition for his outstanding work in africa and 
the world. in recent years, he met several times with then-
President Nelson mandela of South africa to share visions 
and strategies for world peace.
</span><br>
<span className="">in  addition  to  encouraging  self-sufficiency  through  the 
development of schools, clinics, farm projects, and cottage 
industries,  Bhakti  Tirtha  Swami  conducted  seminars  and 
work shops  on  principle-centered 
leadership,  spiritual 
development,  interpersonal  relationships,  stress  and  time 
management,  and  other  pertinent  topics.  He  was  also 
widely acknowledged as a viable participant in the resolu-
tion of global conflict.
</span><br>
<span className="">On august 5, 2004, Bhakti Tirtha Swami was diagnosed 
with  melanoma  cancer  in  his  left  foot.  although  he  made 
</span><br>
<span className="">every effort to treat his condition, the cancer continued to 
spread,  leading  His  Holiness’  to  teach  the  most  important 
lesson—how to die. During the time after his diagnosis, he 
gave numerous lectures on the topic and completed a book 
of meditations, The Beggar IV: Die Before Dying, also dedi-
cated  to  this  same  topic.  almost  a  year  later,  on  June  27, 
2005, His Holiness departed from this world, surrounded by 
loving friends, relatives, and disciples.
</span><br>
<span className="">although  His  Holiness  Bhakti  Tirtha  Swami  has  seem-
ingly  gone,  he  actually  left  behind  him  a  powerful  legacy 
that  will  continue  to  live  on  through  his  students  and 
well-wishers,  and  especially  through  his  books.  Numerous 
lectures, seminars, and workshops wait in the archives for 
Hari-Nama Press to transcribe and to then publish in future

through these unique books and through the lives of those 
who imbibe his message.
